have over 12 years of experience helping brands make informed business decisions.

Across all clients, my job has always been to feed data & insights into every decision, ensuring that a brand’s efforts are effective, efficient, measurable, and always improving.\\n\\nWhile my background has taught me a breadth of invaluable technical skills, my true passion lies in the art and the people side of market research. I love to transform a complex dataset into a clear narrative, to help a client address a challenge by designing a custom methodology, to unlock a deeper or unexpected human insight that helps inspire a creative idea. These are the things that make me tick, and throughout my career, it has been this passion to collaborate and my relentless pursuit of solutions that has set me apart from others in my field.\\n\\nMy skillset includes the following:\\n- Writing, programming, and analyzing surveys\\n- Translating data into clear, impactful narratives\\n- Building compelling presentations & reports from multiple data sources\\n- Developing audience targeting strategies, profiles & segmentations\\n- Mapping out consumer journeys & brand experiences\\n- Identifying consumer & business trends & insights\\n- Designing measurement plans to quantify marketing impact'"]},"execution_count":188,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["user_description"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":161,"id":"02671acd","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["'1'"]},"execution_count":161,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["num_reviews"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":150,"id":"09634e3c","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"ename":"NoSuchElementException","evalue":"Message: no such element: Unable to locate element: {\"method\":\"xpath\",\"selector\":\"/span\"}\n  (Session info: chrome=98.0.4758.109)\n","output_type":"error","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNoSuchElementException\u001b[0m                    Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-150-ce50631d7c5e>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 1\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mrating_container\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mfind_element_by_xpath\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"/span\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;32m~/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/webelement.py\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36mfind_element_by_xpath\u001b[0;34m(self, xpath)\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m    349\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m    350\u001b[0m         \u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0mReturns\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m--> 351\u001b[0;31m          \u001b[0;34m-\u001b[0m \u001b[0mlist\u001b[0m \u001b[0mof\u001b[0m \u001b[0mWebElement\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m-\u001b[0m \u001b[0ma\u001b[0m \u001b[0mlist\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mwith\u001b[0m \u001b[0melements\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mif\u001b[0m \u001b[0many\u001b[0m \u001b[0mwas\u001b[0m \u001b[0mfound\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m  \u001b[0mAn\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m    352\u001b[0m            \u001b[0mempty\u001b[0m \u001b[0mlist\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mif\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mnot\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m    353\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;32m~/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/webelement.py\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36mfind_element\u001b[0;34m(self, by, value)\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m    657\u001b[0m                 \u001b[0melement\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mscreenshot\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m'/Screenshots/foo.png'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m    658\u001b[0m         \"\"\"\n\u001b[0;32m--> 659\u001b[0;31m         \u001b[0;32mif\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mnot\u001b[0m \u001b[0mfilename\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mlower\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mendswith\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m'.png'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m    660\u001b[0m             warnings.warn(\"name used for saved screenshot does not match file \"\n\u001b[1;32m    661\u001b[0m                           \"type.
