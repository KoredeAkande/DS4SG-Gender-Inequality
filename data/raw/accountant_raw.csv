Don’t let the IRS take advantage of your hard-earned money. Review your US tax returns with a tax professional.

Some people think that not opening a letter from the IRS somehow magically constitutes not receiving the letter. IRS letters don’t work like that. Once it is in your mailbox, it is being mailed by the IRS. 
What to do when you received a letter from the IRS? You have options: taking care of it on your own (if you are a tax lawyer, an enrolled agent, or a CPA). Another option is to contact an enrolled agent that may save you money on the services provided and take care of your IRS problems on the IRS level (just like a CPA or a tax lawyer represent you on the IRS level). Enrolled agents are licensed to represent taxpayers before the IRS. “Tax lawyer near me” google search will take you to agencies that employ a tax lawyer, a CPA, and an enrolled agent. Tax lawyers can also represent you in tax court. A CPA or an enrolled agent can’t represent you in tax court. Most tax problem cases get resolved on the IRS level and never reach the tax court anyway.","[('US English 1', '92%'), ('Preferred Freelancer Program SLA 1', '89%'), ('Accounting Principles 1', '77%'), ('Basic Numeracy 1', '77%')]","[('Accounting', 29), ('Intuit QuickBooks', 27), ('Finance', 24), ('Payroll', 22), ('Bookkeeping', 20), ('Tax', 5), ('Research Writing', 3), ('Tax Law', 3), ('Article Writing', 1), ('Business Analysis', 1), ('Bank Reconciliation', 1), ('Abatement', 1), ('Annual Report Design', 1), ('Research', 0), ('Report Writing', 0), ('Inventory Management', 0), ('English (US) Translator', 0), ('Startups', 0), ('Financial Planning', 0), ('Employment Tax', 0), ('Personal Tax', 0), ('Tax Compliance', 0), ('Tax Compliance and Outsourcing', 0), ('Tax Management Consulting', 0), ('Tax Reporting', 0), ('Corporate Transactions', 0), ('Local Job', 0), ('Workday Financials', 0), ('Corporate Income Tax', 0), ('Personal Income Tax', 0), ('Tax Accounting', 0), ('US Taxation', 0), ('Startup Consulting', 0), ('Tax Preparation', 0), ('Workday Compensation', 0), ('Workday Payroll', 0)]","Heath, United States","October 27, 2017",$99,5.7,5.0,28,3,100,100,95,20

In virtually every office environment, you will come across projects that reoccur at regular intervals, some weekly, some daily, some small and some large but in most instances my services can reduce the time spent on these tasks, virtually eliminating error and therefore saving money.

When working within an IT infrastructure, I am well suited for assessing the needs of a given challenge and for communicating those needs to the appropriate departments. Similarly, I have substantial experience working with smaller firms remotely and am able to assess and quantify their needs quickly.

While at White &Case, LLP I was in charge of the worldwide firm’s massive WordBasic macro set (a macro language built into Word 95). Although my original responsibility was to manage the existing code and write new code when requested, I took it upon myself to write some extensive documentation for the Help Desk to assist them in tracking problems relating to the macros. I understand that much of that documentation continued to be referenced up to the point that the firm converted to Word 2000.

I very much enjoy a challenge and have no problem in heavily researching Help files, the MSDN website, newsgroups and picking the brains of my colleagues. As a matter of pride, I work hard to avoid re-inventing the wheel. In most cases, I consider it my responsibility to deliver solutions that balance time, cost and quality and effectively as possible. In many cases, finding an existing product that fits the requirements 90% may be the best thing I can do for my client.

I began working in a large CPA firm in 2005 as a full charge bookkeeper for numerous businesses where I quickly transitioned to handling one on one training for clients as well as teaching group QuickBooks classes. I did in-person classes in South Dakota and Wyoming, and I also did a weekly webinar series–way before Zoom was popular! I taught hundreds of bookkeepers and small business owners how to use their QuickBooks more efficiently and to produce financial reports to help manage their business. Almost 17 years ago I saw a need for education and support for business owners and their bookkeepers and I'm still going strong! I moved to a smaller accounting firm in 2013 where I shifted my focus to tax returns but I was still the “go to” person for everything related to QuickBooks in our office. Before the owner's retirement in August 2021, our small firm did 800+ tax returns each year (combined individual and businesses).

Now I do taxes for individuals, corporations and partnerships, consulting, new bookkeeping set up, software conversions, bookkeeping, bank/credit card reconciliations, journal entries, clean up, payroll, sales tax, etc. I am very efficient with QuickBooks and am well known for finding ways to work smarter- not harder. I am also knowledgeable in various other software programs- Accounting CS, T-Value, Microsoft Office, Lacerte, ATX, File Cabinet to name a few. I have year round clients I perform monthly reviews of financial statements and the general ledger. I also have clients I only do year end reviews along with assisting with W2s, year end payroll reporting and 1099s. I make sure that the books aren’t “out of sight – out of mind” once they are presented to the tax preparer. It’s important to see the year end tasks all the way to the end. 

I understand that larger projects take a lot of time. Sometimes billing clients by the hour isn’t ideal and having a fixed rate can assure them that the project isn’t going to put them in the poor house. To assist the owner with budgeting and cash flow purposes for an ongoing engagement, I prefer to do a fixed monthly or quarterly fee based on the needs at the time. We will review the engagement each year to determine if any changes should be made. 

I've been in this industry for almost 30 years and have discovered most people/businesses have anxiety when it comes to their taxes or bookkeeping. Let me help make it less stressful so you can get back to doing the things that you are passionate about.

Efficiency and Ease of Use. Spreadsheets are powerful tools, and if built correctly, should be easy to use and maintain. Spreadsheets should work FOR YOU and not the other way around.

Problem Solver. I like things tidy and neat, not only in my house but in bookkeeping as well. If there’s an issue to be resolved, I will seek a solution and put processes in place to ensure the issue doesn’t recur.

Communication. I like to obtain full detail of the task at hand and in turn, provide the solutions I’ve implemented in a clear and concise manner.

Learn. I love learning new things, whether it’s new Accounting software or other interests. I’ve successfully taken a number of online QuickBooks courses recently, and am eager to put my newly trained skill to use. Other things I’ve learned as a passionate hobby of mine - photography, from features on the lens and camera to proper lighting and focusing on the subject to be photographed.

I am an Accountant with a strong background in Accounts Payable and General Ledger, who has taken a brief break from the corporate world to move back to Michigan and assist with my elderly mother. For the past few years, I worked a seasonal position nearby that was less demanding then positions I’ve held in the past.

I can help with that, my friend. After all, my business *exists* to maximize the value of your business’ books!

You run your business. I'll run your books.

I'm a senior accounting student, as well as a business owner, bookkeeper, and small business consultant at KopperBooks.

My clients develop a deeper understanding of their business’ strengths & weaknesses, as well as tighter control over their money – where it comes from, how to use it more efficiently, and where the heck it goes!

My goal is always to remove the burden and confusion of bookkeeping from your to-do list, so that YOU can focus on the heart of your business – what you’re really passionate about, what only you can do, and the reason you launched your own business in the first place!

I handled day-to-day tasks related to data entry, client contact, payroll, bookkeeping, tax resolution, finance preparations, and many other finance and accounting skills. One of my job duties was to be a personal assistant to two clients. In this role, I handled all back-office functions. As a result of my work for these clients, I became proficient at reading blueprints and preparing bid proposals. As an experienced bidder and contract preparer, I have worked on numerous government contracts. I regularly review qualifications, requirements, and paperwork to comply with Federal, DOT, State, and local agreements. During my time with the client, I prepared a winning proposal. This contract would generate over a million dollars in revenue for my client over three years.
