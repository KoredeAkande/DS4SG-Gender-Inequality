I love big ideas, the right words, and collaboration.

I help brands find better ways to engage audiences. I’m a content strategy lead, creative director, and marketing copywriter. I love working with clients to mine the big idea, and once found, roll up my sleeves and dive into execution.

I’ve used my talent for telling a story and cutting to the heart of the matter as an ad man, a newspaper editor, a brand strategist, a content creator, UX writer, a speech writer, a game developer, and poet.

Mark Twain said, “The difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.”

I've made my living finding the right words.

I can work alone. But I hate silos. I’m at my best truly collaborating with other creative, passionate, energetic people “bouncing ideas off one another” and pushing toward a common goal. Of course, before creative gets to shine, it has to win the business. I can help there, too. Thinking about the brand. Driving discovery. Making pitches, writing proposals, solving the client need -- not just the one in the RFP, but the one they don't even know they have.

Facebook, Instagram, Youtube... you name the platform, I'm on it

So what can I do for you exactly?

In one sentence I can help you SELL your product/service Online.

It's that easy.

I am 25 years old and I have been Marketing online for businesses for the past 3 years. I learned this skill 3 years ago when I was browsing ways to help my friend's business. 

He's an Insurance agent here in California, he knew I was pretty ""techy"" and I was always reading and learning about the newest/hottest trends if it had to do with the internet. 

So he reached out and asked if there was a way I could help him advertise his business on Facebook, and he'd shoot me some cash.

I went online, did some research and found a few mentors along the way (even paid for some mentors).

Long story short, I helped him branch out into 6 offices in 6 different cities and YES I still do the marketing for him he was my first client ever.

Since then I've gained many clients and realized that I love online marketing. 

I love the game of learning all the subconscious triggers associated with words, images, hand gestures, and voice intonations that sway the audience into watching your advertisement online. 

There are many moving pieces from the ""Creative"" which is your video, photo, captions, and everything that the audience will consume; to the backend--the trackers, audience data, testing, and all of the ""numbers"" of this profession.

Just like anything else, advertising online is a SKILL. 

It's the same reason why you wouldn't let your niece who just picked up photography take your wedding photos. 

It's also the same reason why you are reading these last few sentences... on average any given user on an average website will read 20% of the ""description"" field. Unless...

You got a good copywriter aka marketer aka guy who can help you sell your stuff.

Anyhow, wanna know how I did it?

Well, that's a tough question. That's like me asking my Mexican grandmother how she makes the chicken for her famous enchiladas. 

She could give me the same exact recipe (if she even knew it, she usually just sticks her pink in for a taste test and adds flavor as she FEELS is fit. There is no actual recipe she follows)

Anyhow, I'll give you SOME of the ingredients,. which are the same we'll be using to cook up your next advertisement: 

1. Honor the audience's goldfish attention span (I'm not calling your mental capacity short, it's just the data says on average our attention spans have shrunk)

2. Tell a story, I could've listed what I can do BUT lets face it that's basic, generic, boring, AND you still would not know me and what I do. 

3. Formatting & vocab . No long and wordy paragraphs, this isn't a dissertation.

That's all I can give ya, and if we are being honest you probably knew those already. Just like I know that my grandmas enchiladas have chicken, tortillas and red sauce.

What I'm trying to say is that you got the right guy here.",[],"[('Copywriting', 0), ('Internet Marketing', 0), ('Facebook Marketing', 0), ('Leads', 0), ('Affiliate Marketing', 0), ('Social Media Marketing', 0), ('Instagram Marketing', 0), ('Social Video Marketing', 0), ('Lead Generation', 0), ('TikTok', 0), ('Social Media Copy', 0), ('English Translation', 0), ('Tiktok Ads', 0), ('Instagram Ads', 0), ('Facebook Ads', 0)]","Tulare, United States","November 8, 2021",$30,0.0,0.0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Helping businesses of all sizes optimize their brand strategy and find their true north, voice and niche so they can stand out amongst the chatter, grow faster and have a sustainable future is something I enjoy deeply.

I know that at the end of the day, you need happy, loyal and raving fans who will serve as advocates for your brand for years to come. That's why I believe in customer-led strategies that meet people in the right place, at the right time and with the right message. If you're looking for B2C or B2B copy, I've got the tools, skills and knowledge to get the job done ... and done right. 

I've worked in a variety of marketing and advertising mediums with clients all across the business spectrum, whether that be self-defense, firearms, health, supplements or a professional firm.

I skillfully craft each word and base much of my writing on a strong foundation of research, user experience, testing and optimization through iterations. In addition to this, I also hold a strong background in email creation and automation, as well as direct response marketing.

Though creativity is essential, I take pride in my ability to concept larger-than-life ideas while remaining grounded in the reality of both feasibility and ease of execution. Project management, organization and improving processes is my jam — and nothing beats a fresh style guide or SOP.

The bonus? I work efficiently and effectively on my own and in a team setting, too. Working under pressure and strict deadlines? That, right there ... is my appetizer.

Growing up I always wanted to be a copywriter without understanding what that really was. I pictured myself sitting around a big boardroom table, in my pants suit, with high-level executives spit-firing slogans. Thanks Hollywood!
I quickly learned in college that there wasn’t a degree for that. I started out on the path to a Mass Communications Major. I enjoyed writing. I wanted to make a difference. The masses not only wanted to hear what I had to say, they needed to hear it because my words were like diamonds falling from the sky. College kids are so naïve! While taking the basic college classes I started interning at a small local newspaper. 
I started off filing papers and answering phones. As I became comfortable with the office I got to sell classified ads. One weekend they were short on staff to cover a local event. They asked if I wanted to take a stab at it, and write a small piece for the paper. I was STOKED! I get to actually write for the paper! What was the event? The local hot dog eating contest. I don’t even like hot dogs, but I didn’t let that get me down. My tag line, “Ketchup to the Hot Dog Weiner!” There it was in black and white with my name on the by line. Honestly, it felt silly. I was proud, but a little embarrassed. The publisher loved it. I went on to cover local events, interview and write about local political campaigns. 
I started realizing that everything that was actually published leaned in certain directions and with less opinions. Yes, I know journalism in that sense is to report on facts and such, and not have your own opinions come across in the words. It is then that I realized that was not the kind of writing I was interested in. I got a paying job with another publisher selling advertising. It was a small business where I was able to write copy, work with the graphics department, learn how to layout, and build relationships with all types of local business owners. 
 In my next attempt to find a way to write while making money I landed a job with a production company. Sounds fun, right? I sold TV advertising in rural areas on major cable networks.
I spent the next decade of my life owning my own business, a sports bar named Dazzlers. That was so much fun, so much work, and so rewarding! It, too, is a whole book in itself. I sure do have some stories from that place! I enjoyed planning events, throwing parties, promoting myself and the bar. I was still writing. I wrote schedules, social media posts, made flyers, filled out tax documents, wrote boring policies that legally had to be in place. It wasn’t all glamorous.
This brings me to the present day where I decided this is the time for me to put my energy back into the writing that I always wanted to do. My husband is supportive, we have set up an office at home where I can work, and I am committing my time to research, writing, and making sales materials for companies.",[],"[('Copywriting', 0), ('Proofreading', 0), ('Blog', 0), ('Editing', 0), ('Article Writing', 0), ('Affiliate Marketing', 0), ('Creative Writing', 0), ('Content Writing', 0), ('Content Marketing', 0), ('Sales Promotion', 0), ('Brand Marketing', 0), ('Taglines', 0), ('Headlines', 0), ('Content Creation', 0), ('Memoir Writing', 0)]","Myrtle Beach, United States","February 3, 2022",$20,0.0,0.0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Creating a long lasting relationship with your clients will not only make them happy, but they will be singing the praises of your great business. Praises that will more than likely bring you more clients.

Here’s how I can help you with that!

I specialize in (and willing to expand further):

>Creating compelling copy for websites and webpages ( Content writing, blog post, sales funnels)
>Collaborating with you to determine your needs and work with you to get the best results
>Modernizing copy on poorly performing websites
>Product descriptions
>Biographies
>Proofreading

Compelling copy for your website or webpage: Rather you want to get a new website up and running or you want to keep creating great content for your already established site, I can help you with that. You want concise copy that meets the eye and makes visitors want to take action!

The goal when working with you is to get inside the mind of your company and find out how to appeal to your audience. By doing that, I will research your company to learn more about your products and services, and who your audience is. I can also provide a questionnaire that will help me get some information about your company.

Biographies: I will highlight the most important things about you and your company, and put it into compelling copy.

Proofreading: Before you put yourself out there, you will want to make sure that you sound great and your audience knows that you are a pro. I can proofread your content to make sure there are no errors and to make sure your tone is relatable to your audience.


For the past seven years while obtaining my Bachelor's in Communications and beyond, I have worked as a substitute teacher. Doing so has taught me flexibility, time management, problem solving, adaptability, passion, and really strong communication skills. All of these things I will use when working with you.

I am an ambitious copywriter who wants to help you captivate your audience with compelling words.

Even a 1,000-word article can take 30 minutes or more of researching to give proof and credibility to the content. Sales letters and marketing promotions can take much longer. Yet, that’s not the most valuable way your writers can spend their time (it’s probably not the most valuable way you can spend your time, either). So, let me take it on. Let me do the research for you — and deliver it on a silver platter for you and your writers to use. I’ll sort and sift through the millions and millions of pages of content on the Internet — focusing on credible and quotable sources your writers can use to provide maximum proof behind what they’re writing about. I’ll find what’s most relevant and leave out the rest. Then your writers can focus on doing that one task that gives you the most value — writing! As they write, they can just scan through the focused research I provide to quickly pull out the quote, statistic, or other element that will make their copy as persuasive as possible. Not only will it help them write stronger, more compelling messages — many copywriters have reported that having research at their side helps them write faster as well. You’ll find it’s a wise investment, too — you can hire me to do the research and I can work to match your budget and research demands. Please contact me immediately — whether you’re ready to move forward today or not — to let me know you’re interested.

I use the StoryBrand method to clarify your message and transform your online presence which builds trust and leads to higher conversions.

I work with brands of all sizes in the health and wellness niche. We do everything from creating brand guides and establishing brand voice, to designing logos, package design, full website design and development (using WordPress, Wix and Shopify), and email marketing campaigns.

If you want to take your business to the next level, you HAVE to know how to connect with your audience. To do that, you need a copywriter with healthcare experience. 

I am a Registered Nurse turned copywriter with over 10 years of experience writing for health and wellness companies. This brings a unique perspective to my writing. I specialize in clarifying and simplifying health-related topics, breaking them down so they are easy to understand for the average person. My natural writing style is very friendly and conversational while bringing a down-to-earth air of authority and trust. If you want to connect with your customers, resonate with them on a deep level, and have them view your brand as the answer to their concerns, this is the way to go.

From Jan. 2020 through July 2021, I worked with a multi-million dollar supplement company as their Lead Copywriter and Head of Research. While in this role, I wrote all of the copy for their website, lead magnets, Amazon listings, landing pages, and email marketing. 

I have a signature 3-step process that I use with every client. I use the Storybrand method to create your brand voice and story.

Imagine having more time and energy to focus on scaling your business and creating new products, instead of spending valuable time trying to figure out how to write a copy that will actually sell and attract new customers. 

I have been professionally writing copies that convert for over half a decade. I have driven over $1.5M in sales through various types of copy. 

I follow a rather systematic approach to crafting sales copy that will convert. Some examples of services I provide includes: 

• Academic Papers 
• Website/Blog Articles
• E-mail copywriting 
• Product descriptions 
• Public Speeches
• Podcast Scripts

If you choose to hire me, I'll make sure that you're provided with premium quality copies that actually convert. I don't shy away from rounds of revisions, if needed, to ensure you are satisfied with the final product.

It is important that you choose your words wisely and carefully because words are the fastest way to get your brand into your customer’s minds and ensure it stays there.

Exactly the reason why you need a master storyteller, a word wizard who can weave a compelling narrative that stays with your target audience.

If you are looking for just a copywriter, then move on.

But if you are looking for a word whisperer - to create copy that puts into words exactly what your customers want to hear, who’ll take your big ideas and transform it into simple but compelling narratives that will set your copy apart from that of the competition then connect with me today.

I love words, and I love the power they hold. Reading a well written story always enthrals me and that is what I aim to do with every copy I put out. Whether it is writing an ad copy, or a blog on travel and living or a heavy research based technical blog, I try to write content that enthrals.

Over the course of the years, I have written numerous blogs on various topics under the sun. I dive into every piece of content with the passion and empathy needed to connect and engage with your target audience. I ensure every article I write is backed by thorough research, proper grammar checks and the appropriate style required. I am happy to work closely with clients, graphic designers or other writers in your team, if that will help me understand your requirements better.

I'm Cody Garrett and I have numerous years of experience when it comes to writing. First starting as a creative writer in publishing, in the last few years, I have transitioned into becoming a copywriter. Over the years, I have written clean, error-free copy for a variety of businesses and institutions which includes: restaurants, banks, hospitals, nonprofits, marketing agencies, and car dealerships. I also write long-form travel blogs for Expedia, Facebook Ads, blogs for slots, and blogs about living a healthy lifestyle. I also have experience writing product descriptions and resumes and cover letters. No matter what project you need clean copy for, I can deliver tangible and measurable results with an engaging, entertaining, but clear and concise voice. My experience with creative writing coupled with SEO, B2B, B2C, and proficiency in programs such as Google Docs and Microsoft Word will be of essential help!

I have many interests and changed the field of my professional activity several times. 
I have higher education in psychology and Russian philology. Therefore, I have experience in writing scientific articles, reviews, reports based on the analysis of research data, essays. As a philologist, I am also interested in working with the translation of an English text into Russian.
I also have experience as a copywriter. I wrote short commercial texts - product descriptions, advertising articles, letters for clients and more.
My hobby is postcrossing and I had my own postcard shop. Thanks to this, I have the skills of prepress preparation of images (printing postcards, stickers) and preparing layouts (e.g. converting bitmaps to vectors, drawing hand sketches) for making stamps and seals for poscrossers. I work with Photoshop and Corel Draw.
Thus, I am interested in working with various texts and images.

One of the best tools your business can use to connect with customers is words. 

Before you start your website, start the design, work on your ads, emails or social posts - get the copy right. Business content or copy is more important than anything else, it's what attracts and converts. Copy is a driving force. 

I've been digital marketing for companies for a little over 10-years. I've worked with SMB's, ecom, and small enterprise companies. I have a deep love for analytics and see copywriting as a big driving force to many marketing initiatives. I still work on SEO projects as my services intersect at several places.

Do you want content that persuade consumers to BUY?

Fresh, informative, and thoughtful content is where it's at! Forget run-of-the-mill content that sounds like every other product or recycled manufactured copy that does nothing to entice customers or help boost your SEO rankings. As your dedicated copywriter, I will convert your click-through visitors into paying clients with content that not only informs, but persuades customers to see how your product benefits them. It's time for content that lets a consumer see how their life can benefit from having your product or using your service. Turn passive views into that ""I have to have this!"" sale with descriptions that paint a picture and provide enticing insight into your product.

What makes me the perfect copywriter for you? I have over six years experience specializing in writing product descriptions, catalog copy, meta descriptions, product reviews, blog posts, product titles and more for a range of ecommerce and celebrity clients. I understand the importance of SEO and LSI keywords, and am familiar with how to work them into a description to improve rankings without penalization from ""overstuffing."" I work fast and pay attention to detail. I am creative, possess a fluent command of the English language and understand sales copy and what makes intriguing website content. I understand my niche well and produce quality work worth every penny. Some freelancers rush through their work and as a result, their copy is bland and lacks that spark that sells/highlights products, but I take pride in every word that goes into my copy and the results reflect that dedication and attention to detail.

I believe that every product and company has a story to tell. Whether your vision for your descriptions includes poetic prose, conversation style, brief and to-the-point, descriptive and detailed, or lifestyle picture painting, I am your copywriter.

Thank you for your time and consideration of my application. If you enjoyed the sample articles I included and are seeking a talented and professional writer, please contact me regarding the specifics of this job as I would love to work with you to create engaging content that your readers will enjoy.

And, he has personally earned 14 national, state & local Advertising & Deign awards as a Creative Director, Art Director & Copywriter.

In addition, Lee has created, written, designed & produced numerous White Papers, on various general & specific topics. For example: “MISSION EVERGREEN: A Carbon Emissions Briefing”.

Or more qualified leads? 

Or a chronically-addicting email sequence that will run on autopilot, continuously generating both once you press play?

I can make it happen. 

I've got over four years of experience writing magnetic yet non-sleazy sales copy for a wide range of industries, niches, and business types - both online and off. 

I cut my teeth for two and a half years in the hyper-competitive direct mail game -which was a fantastic, hard-hitting training ground- and brought in hundreds of thousands of dollars in new business over this time. 

Over the last few years I've taken everything I know online, and have especially done a deep dive into email marketing systems.

Really want to know what kind of chops and methods a copywriter is bringing to the table before you hire them? 

Ask them who their mentors are. 

Mine are legendary direct response guys such as Gary Halbert, Gene Schwartz and Dan Kennedy. 

Joanna Weibe has done a great job of adapting the principles from these old masters, combining them with a leaner, modern, messaging style. 

My methods? 

#1 Is understanding the members of your market. 

#2 Is understanding them MORE. 

#3 Is worming inside their heads to devour any and all mundane details about them until I understand their REAL wants, needs, dreams and private fears until I instinctively know what emotional and logical strings to tug on to convert them into a customer because I've become one of them. 

Gaining that core market understanding is 80% of the battle. Seriously. Most copywriters won't tell you that, and if they insist otherwise it's probably because they don't really understand SALES copy. Sure they might be good *writers*, but sales is a different animal. 

Sales isn't not about impressing them with facts about your company or product (you're far more likely to bore them), it's not about wowing them with your linguistic tricks and tying sentences into elaborate knots, it's certainly not about LYING to them. 

It's about empathy. 

I truly believe that if the product is really something that they want, or something that will solve their problems, people WANT to be sold to. They're BEGGING for it. Really! Not only that, but it is a salespersons OBLIGATION to make that a reality. 

It's just got to be done in the right way. With empathy. If a copywriter can really understand and empathize with a group of prospects - and he or she has a good product to put in front of them real magic can happen for both parties involved. 

The actual WORDS that grab the sale are nothing but a vehicle for surfacing certain emotions in the prospect (about 70% of the game) and giving them some logical reasons to justify their decision (the other 30%). 

There are thousands of techniques for doing those two things, far too many to talk about here, but if you want to know more about MY style of copywriting this could help paint a better picture... 

Jason's top 3 'Copy Commandments': 

- ""Be cautious of 'overhyping' your reader, but be *terrified* of boring them!"" 

- ""Write to be read and understood, not to impress."" 

- ""It's about THEM, stupid!"" 

I love the copywriting and sales process, and would be so happy to talk about your business or project and help you reach your goals. 

Look forward to hearing from you! 

-Jason Mahr- 

PS: One thing I feel obligated to mention is that I am selfish. 


And this is a good thing for you...

See, as an ambitious young copywriter it's in my own best interest to make sure that I am bringing not only a pleasant and professional experience to my clients, but RESULTS. 

If I bring stellar results I keep you guys happy, get more referrals, make more money, and drink more mojitos. All great things for me. 

Because your results are what matter most to me, you'll likely find that I'm easy to work with and flexible (within reason) for any changes that need to be made, or any follow up conversations we need to have.

I worked daily with the Head of Brand and Industrial Design, Packaging, Social, Digital, Marketing, and Web Development teams to create compelling copy that drove conversions and cemented the brand’s image before it was scooped up by Pattern (a big win!). I also wrote cold and warm emails on behalf of the CEO. If you need something written well, just send it over and I’ll get it done.

I’m a natural multitasker, so juggling multiple assignments in a fast-paced environment is a-ok with me (preferred, actually!). Feedback is a privilege in my opinion, so I’m happy to revise upon request. No hurt feelings, ever. I am only interested in results!

I’m also an idea machine, so brainstorming creative strategies is super fun for me. I can write in a multitude of voices as well. I’m analytical yet creative, which comes in handy when evaluating KPIs and adjusting strategies.

And while I appreciate any feedback given, I am not crippled by a need for it. I take ownership of the projects I’m working on with an anticipatory and collaborative spirit. I’m also a standup comedian, which helps sharpen my pen so I can write intriguing copy that has a sense of rhythm, flow, and timing. It also makes me thick-skinned and pretty fun to work with!

In December 2019, she fulfilled her degree requirements for a Bachelor of Arts in Media Arts with a Journalism emphasis.

Cogswell completed her undergraduate capstone project on The Splintering Influence of Columbine which was evaluated through cultural scripts, media cultivation theory, and public perception with a survey that polled 118 high school students. The project’s findings showed that the majority of high school students analyzed mass school shootings according to the cultural script set in place for such events, leaning towards answers that aligned with the script, even if these were not founded in reality. The project also discussed video games and YA fiction that featured violent content as well as the extensive investigative work of Dave Cullen in dispelling misconceptions that have surrounded the 1999 Columbine Massacre for the past 2 decades.

In 2020, Taylyn Cogswell began working at Kiara Sky Professional Nails & Glam and Glits Nail Design as a part of their Marketing team. Her responsibilities have included authoring Youtube scripts, educational blog posts, social media captions, as well as the brand mission statement. Cogswell took over the Public Relations responsibilities for the company in the summer of 2020, communicating directly with influencers, sending PR packages and coordinating new product launches and campaigns.

Cogswell has an extensive digital repertoire of work that includes article writing, photography, video editing, performance art, and design. As a photographer, she often utilizes multimedia tools at her disposal to create both marketing and journalistic content such as custom logos, flyers, websites, full-length videos and photo essays that contain original interviews, images, and narration all of which are synthesized on this portfolio webpage.

Taylyn is deeply inspired by the messages and work from Atlas Obscura’s editorials and immersive excursions, Alex Schegetz’s inspirational Hauntingly Human website and Sorelle Amore’s masterful marketing and self-portrait photography skills.

Cogswell has an affinity for travel, history and world cultures and has her sights set on joining creative and passionate teams in nearly every industry as a Brand Partnerships Strategist, a Digital Marketing Specialist, or perhaps a Creative Director/Director of Experiences.

Taylyn is the creator and administrator of various business and portfolio webpages, including ecommerce storefronts. For more: [login to view URL]

You don’t know if you should focus on Social Media, Podcasting or Blogging. Or whatever new trend pops up (is Clubhouse still a thing?)

I’m here to help you communicate better in your biz and focus on the words that matter. With copywriting and content that delivers the results you want.

That means keeping your reader engaged and excited to read each sentence and listen to every word. At least long enough for her to reach your sales pitch and click that link to opt in. That’s where I come in…

I specialize in b2b copywriting and content for women-led and women-focused brands.

Here’s what’s in my wheelhouse:

Emails
Sales page copy
Website copy
Product and service descriptions

I worked in marketing for nearly 10 years and was a marketing manager for Swarovski’s charm jewelry line, Chamilia, for 5 of those years. I am now looking to move away from marketing and build my own freelance copywriting business. Copywriting has always been a large part of my career and one of my favorite aspects of marketing.

Marketing has taught me how to use writing to convey a brand’s values, tone of voice, and consistent messaging and I believe clear, concise copy can help a brand communicate their value, connect with their customers, and ultimately increase their revenue. I have experience writing blog posts, social media posts, press releases, YouTube video descriptions, marketing documents, global advertising campaigns, and catalog product descriptions.

At this point I am looking for all the copywriting experience I can get to build up my portfolio and advance to the next stage of my career. Please let me know if you are looking for any of the following services at a great rate!

Current copywriter. I like to play around with words to convey ideas. 

After working in the teaching field for several years, I got tired of grading papers and decided to take all the skills I had acquired and try something new. Sort of like Walter White. Except instead of meth I would be making ads and writing copy. 

The best way to distinguish your product or service is through simple and concise language—with a dash of humor too. My specialty as a copywriter is giving your brand a voice that delivers a clear message to your customers. Whether it's short copy, long copy, or anything in between, I always deliver words that sell.

I have published thousands of blogs, social posts, emails, and websites for hundreds of different businesses in dozens of unique verticals.

Some of my favorite projects have included:

- Managing a national team of media buyers and promotions specialists to promote live events in Los Angeles, Washington DC, San Francisco/Bay Area, NYC, and other major markets throughout the U.S. As the key strategist for the enacted plans, my role was to understand the events we were promoting inside and out, develop a plan to promote that event efficiently and effectively, and then manage the execution of that plan across numerous teams, each of which had its own unique specialty. Gauging response from the public and then adjusting the plan (including an audible or two), is one of my favorite, and time-tested, wats of ensuring maximum results for any project.

- Spearheading strategic plans for numerous startups, midsized businesses, and multi-national companies that originated with strategy sessions and blossomed into fully realized campaigns. I've worked with clients ranging from venerable botanical gardens to medical technology innovators to rooftop film screenings and many others to deliver campaigns that communicate important messages, increase awareness, and generate desired results.

- Developing concepts for regional and national advertising and interactive marketing campaigns for nonprofit financial organizations to help promote equity and equal access to small business loans in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Chicago, and the Tri-State Area.

Tired of hiding in the shadows and whispering anytime there is any talk about marijuana, people are demanding a reform that would make cannabis more accessible and less stigmatized. Imagine, living during a time when cannabis is regarded more of a household staple, like aspirin or butter, instead of something that is going to ruin your life. With more studies being done and more information becoming available to the public every year, more and more people are opting for more natural remedies for everything from self-care to pain management instead of relying solely from pharmaceutical drugs. With all the ill side effects from pharmaceuticals, it was only a matter of time before the people say ""enough is enough, there has to be another way…"" There is another way, and the people know it and are no longer asking for it, but are demanding it, as we saw across the country during our last election in the U.S. Having been a cannabis enthusiast and advocate for the better part of 15 years, and a writer for even longer, I am excited to combine & share my passion for both to help assist cannabis-based businesses with unique copywriting that is as engaging as well as informative for people, no matter where they are on their journey. I love the research that is required to transform a brand's digital copy into something that is personal while reflecting each brands individual mission statement. Not only do I research your brand in depth, but I study your competitors as well.

• Native English Speaker/Writer
• Writing & Grammar Fluency
• Copy Writing/Editing
• Proofreading
• CMoS, MLA, AP Style
• Microsoft Word & Publisher 
• PowerPoint
• Blogging
• Story Flow
• SEO Proficient

Writing has always been a way for me to share, and a way to help others catch a vision. Through storytelling and appropriate analogies, people can identify and understand complex concepts. My blog entries have always been story-centered.

Story topics have focused on personal interests such as family and family history, travel, cooking, home improvement, parenting, exercise, the great outdoors, and pets. 

I feel that stories are a way to open up pathways to communication, nurture and sometimes repair family relationships, and create new friendships. Language leads to communication, and with communication comes understanding.

I'm an Ethical Hacker and Web Developer turned Copywriter in the Tech Industry.

After years working in this industry, a lot of business owners seem to complain about experiencing this one common issue:

They'd pay hundreds of dollars for a custom website, then spend even more money for SEO and Paid traffic, but still don't make enough money to justify the costs.
They knew they had a great website, a great product, but it still felt so hard, and the fees were eating them alive every month for practically no results.

That's why I am here on Freelancer; I am on a mission to help you turn my words into your profit.

When working with me, you'll get compelling email and website copy created with a proprietary technique I made called ""The SpyGlass Method.""

This simple 6-phase method, modeled after government computer hacking methodology, will maximize your website copy to sell more products while turning your email list into raving fans ... all without headaches, pissed-off customers, and sleazy marketing. 

If you'd like to put this powerful 6-phase framework to work in your email list or website copy, Send me a direct message today, and let's see if we're a good fit.",[],"[('Copywriting', 0), ('Technical Writing', 0), ('Ghostwriting', 0), ('Article Writing', 0), ('Product Descriptions', 0), ('Article Rewriting', 0), ('Google Adsense', 0), ('Copy Typing', 0), ('Real Estate', 0), ('Email Marketing', 0), ('Creative Writing', 0), ('Content Writing', 0), ('Content Strategy', 0)]","Baltimore, United States","August 2, 2020",$47,0.0,0.0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

But I'd rather tell the truth than doing a bad job for a client.

Let's face it. When you're looking at a freelancer's profile or when they send you proposals, they are mostly boilerplate. If you are looking to stand out from the online crowd, let's talk.

It's not about them, it's about YOU and YOUR audience. So yes, I have a business degree, a master in marketing, won international tech contests and +7 years of corporate experience. But who cares about me when I want to get to know YOU and YOUR business? Your ""WHY""?

Probably the proposals you receive are ""Yes sir, I can do this"". But, WHERE'S THE VALUE? If you give me a structure for doing something and I think it (sorry) sucks, I'd rather tell you the truth than performing a bad job for you with something that won't work.

I have also grown Instagram and Youtube accounts from zero to 100K+ followers in a year or less through content alone.

Finally, I have personally managed as much as $3 million in monthly paid media spend across paid search, paid social, and programmatic display and have been able to take my former paid media expertise to my freelance work.

Your business is thriving! Profit is flowing in. You've perfected all aspects of your product or service, but you know your marketing can be improved.

Or, maybe your business is not doing very well after all. There's nothing wrong with what you're selling, but you are having trouble acquiring customers regardless. ""There HAS to be a missing piece in my business strategy,"" you tell yourself.

No matter which situation you're in, the cure is clear: you need a copywriter. 

Specifically, you need one who can:

 - Advertise the best parts of your product or service
 - Drive potential customers to your business
 - Write in a clear, concise manner

Don't just hire a copywriter. Anyone with a keyboard can say they are a 'Copywriter'.

Hire a craftsman of compelling copy--

Immediately following graduation from the College of Charleston Business School, I started my career as a digital marketing specialist with a focus on Marketing and SEO for a Charleston-based company. I quickly moved up the ranks by taking on additional projects and responsibilities. Over time, I increased my involvement in all facets of digital marketing until I was managing ad budgets in excess of $10,000,000.

After taking some time off from the agency, I began freelancing writing blog posts for clients. By building a consistent rapport with them, I was able to help out in more ways, consulting on business practices, project management, and marketing initiatives. With this steady flow of small jobs, I was able to turn a fun side project into a sustainable career.

My experiences have led me to gain skills in almost every niche of marketing, from strategy and implementation to online research, project management, customer-facing copywriting, and inbound marketing. These skills have given me a level of knowledge paralleled by only expert marketers in the freelance space.

I take your business messages from unclear to clear and create content that attracts customers and grows revenue, in one session.

Your customers want two things:
1. to understand what problem your product/service solves, and
2. how it will make their life better.

I can help you accomplish both those items, with clear messaging by way of a story that places your customer as the hero and your product/service as the guide - that's the Storybrand way.

Customers will listen, follow, and buy from you when you have a clear message about how your product/service helps them survive. That's what every customer wants to know!

It's a simple formula, using a story technique, that tells your customers:

1. What you offer.
2. How it makes their life better.
3. How to purchase it.

It's a process we work through together to generate the story of your brand and create a foundation for all your marketing materials.

I can help you with:
- website copy (new or revision of existing)
- landing pages
- product descriptions
- brand messaging
- using a story brand framework

This method will get your product/service:
1. attention
2. increased traffic
3. valuable data about your audience
