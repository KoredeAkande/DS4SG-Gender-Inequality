marketing,Jared T.,https://www.freelancer.com/u/sawyer706,Marketing Strategy and Content Development,"•••A Bit About Me•••

Hi there. I'm Jared, but professionally I go by my middle name, which is Sawyer (unfortunately Freelancer won't let me edit my name). I'm thirty-one, and I work as an Account Director at a healthcare marketing agency in New York. At the end of February, I will leave my corporate job to become a full-time freelancer, and I would love to work with you.

I moved to New York in March 2020 from Sydney, Australia. I’m originally from the US (born in a small town in Georgia; went to college in DC), but after I graduated from college in 2011 I moved to Australia with my partner at the time. Australia is as great a place as any for a new college grad to start their career, so I quickly got a job working in marketing for a startup, and the rest is history.

•••My Professional Background•••

I've spent the past ten years working in digital marketing and sales strategy for leading multinational healthcare companies, including Merck, Eli Lilly, and Amgen. As a side hustle, I’ve also started several companies of my own, mostly in ecommerce. Through my background in corporate marketing and startups, I've gained experience in just about every facet of marketing, ranging from high-level strategy and planning, to the more hands-on aspects, such as website development, marketing automation, email campaign development, copywriting, and more.

•••Effective Marketing•••

Over the last twenty years, as everything has moved online, the way consumers get their information and discover new products has profoundly changed. As a result, so too has marketing and sales. On the one hand, the rise of social media, Google, and digital advertising has given today’s business owners more options to reach customers than ever before. On the other hand, today’s customers are overwhelmed with competing products, information and entertainment. Effective marketing has to cut through the information overload to reach customers when they need a product or service most. On top of that, the customer experience has to be frictionless, or else the customer will lose patience and leave.

•••How I can help you•••

Branding
•Develop a brand identity
•Develop promotional messaging 
•Refresh your website’s look and feel

Market Research
•Identify your target customer
•Product pricing strategy
•Competitor analysis 

Strategy

Full-stack writer- It's not about information. It's about concepts. It's about emotions. It's about a journey. Each word, as a portal toward a decision, revelation, or action. Copywriting is like cooking. Get your ingredients (concepts), set them on the table, find out how to mix them up to get the right taste (emotion), and serve the course from appetizer to dessert in the right order (content strategy).

I am a unique freelancer in that I have a depth of experience in different subjects, clients, products/services.

5. Hourly projects per PRODUCTION HOUR, not finished. A one hour minimum charge may apply for smaller projects. This is subject to review.

6. All projects subject to review prior to any commencement of work. I find myself putting placeholder bids on many projects due to lack of information, such as budget, length, deadline, audio format, file separation, usage rights, etc. This applies ALL projects.

10. I review all projects carefully. Please do not entertain trying to lower my rates,. I have no interest in low paying You Tube narration jobs that pay $10 for a 15 minute script.

Writing sample: 

The Lego Star Wars toys are almost as popular as the movies themselves.

The Star Wars phenomenon that George Lucas created inspired a whole generation of movie goers to cheer for Luke Skywalker, fall in love with Princess Leia, and laugh with the robots C-3PO and R2-D2. They also rooted for the rogue warrior team of Han Solo and Chewbacca, and were shocked when they found out that the evil Darth Vader was really Luke Skywalker's father. This saga has probably created a bigger following than any other movies in the last two decades. The success of these films eventually led to the profitable marketing and sale of products with the Star Wars logo. 
 
They didn't know it at the time, but the Lego Group and George Lucas were working towards the same goals during the filming of theses movies. While George was contemplating how Jedi Knights, light sabers, robots and the Millennium Falcon would save the universe, the Lego Group was busy at work on developing play sets that involved knights, pirates and other fantasy characters. It was inevitable that these two forces of the galaxy would eventually collide. The result was pure genius. 
 
While merchandising has always been a part of the movies, the kind of imagination and ingenuity that it would take to make interactive toys for this science-fiction fantasy could only be accomplished by one company. There are many products that have been manufactured in conjunction with these films, but the Star Wars toys from the Lego Group have consistently managed to remain prominent with fans of these movies and with Star Wars collectors. This is because the company's products are not only accurate, but also spark the imagination of children and adults. 
 
The Lego Group was one of the original manufacturers who wanted to recreate the citizens from this galaxy in the form of miniature figures. As opposed to other toy manufacturers, they also wanted to make the play sets and replicas of the ships buildable so that they were more interactive for younger fans from the ages of six to twelve. Through the magic of the Lego Star Wars experience, children of all ages can make up their own stories about Storm Troopers, Ewoks, Death Stars and anything else they want to think about. 
 
Lego toys have always inspired creativity and imagination. Although the Lego Group started out sellingwooden toys and then plastic building blocks that were used to build miniature farm-style houses, the Lego Group has always moved forward with the products that they manufacture. If you think about it, even Luke Skywalker started out working on a farm for his adopted parents before he set off into space to save the universe. 
 
Everyone looks at the stars and wonders what it would be like to travel there. This is what makes Lego Star Wars products so popular with children and collectors as well. The play sets and spaceships are fun, but for the real collector, the dimensions and the details of the ships are extremely accurate in accordance with the Star Wars movies. Either way, Lego Star Wars toys have managed to capture the original designs and spirit of George Lucas.","Canvas, United States","December 27, 2006",$25,6.4,4.9,174,0,94,100,98,35

The services I offer include startup and small business consulting, with a focus on writing business plans that help secure investor funding or bank loans. 

I also design and launch small business websites that are focused on growing customers, rather than static online business cards. The key is in getting to know your ideal customer, then developing a strategy for attracting them.

I can only help you if you're 100% vested in your business. So, if you're looking for the cheapest 'quick fix', then I'm not your guy. You can't 'buy' a stock business plan for $30-$250 and expect to get funding.

I only want to work with business owners that are serious about developing and growing their business. My idea is to provide value first. Then, hopefully you’ll say “This guy really knows his stuff, I’m going to hire him.”","Los Molinos, United States","May 26, 2016",$50,6.0,5.0,25,0,97,100,100,11

Let's face it. When you're looking at a freelancer's profile or when they send you proposals, they are mostly boilerplate. If you are looking to stand out from the online crowd, let's talk.

It's not about them, it's about YOU and YOUR audience. So yes, I have a business degree, a master in marketing, won international tech contests and +7 years of corporate experience. But who cares about me when I want to get to know YOU and YOUR business? Your ""WHY""?

Probably the proposals you receive are ""Yes sir, I can do this"". But, WHERE'S THE VALUE? If you give me a structure for doing something and I think it (sorry) sucks, I'd rather tell you the truth than performing a bad job for you with something that won't work.

Translation and interpretation

I have spoken Spanish for over 40 years and teach, interpret and translate.

I simultaneously interpret for several agencies, including freelancing for the State of New York and local medical firms. I have lived in Europe for 15 years with ten years in Spain and also ten in Mexico. Instead of using an agency, you have me working directly for you and reporting directly to you.

Marketing and sales

Utilizing the latest digital strategies, my crew and I blend in world-class face-to-face sales and customer service training. We offer you a 'front-to-back' marketing launch or upgrade to make you and your brand shine like the sun.

Based on 'Aloha Spirit' from Hawai'i, USA, our sales training is unique.

If you need a multilingual web site, online store, social network or social media setup, we focus on hard-hitting sales copy with keyword-sensitive texts, ease-of-use and clean, minimalist design with real people featured in the images.

Our unique combination of video (viral-friendly) with posting on Facebook brings in large numbers of targeted local visitors who engage.

Let us show you what good marketing can do for your brand and what top-end sales and motivational coaching can do for you and your staff.

Through my agency the main focus is social media advertising, but I also offer video editing, podcast editing/management, graphic design, website design and for local clients video production. 

With social media marketing I can drive conversions, bring your business leads, drive more traffic to your website, get as many eyes as possible on a video, or get people to send you a message and start a conversation. 

One recent campaign for a client generated them 342 leads for $473 which comes out to $1.38 per lead. Their product was a $33,496 ready to swim pool. They have closed at least 8 of those leads so far!

Another e-commerce client has generated $164,000 in revenue from 1 Google Ad campaign on $33,000 ad spend. That's just under a 500% ROAS! 
 
Video can make a huge impact to your brand awareness. The video editing work that I do involves physical product videos, video for services offered, testimonial videos, home tours for real estate agents, or videos for online products to name a few. To make the most out of your videos I add background music, edit green screen, add seamless transitions between clips, closed captions or add text/logo with or without animation. This all helps with the feel of the video.","Liberty Lake, United States","November 22, 2019",$120,2.6,5.0,4,0,100,100,100,N/A
