Skills include but are not limited to: PCB design, layout, testing, soldering, and verification; embedded software/firmware development and verification, C/C++ programming and algorithmic development; Python scripting, web scraping, data processing and machine/deep learning; system verilog FPGA development.

I have developed numerous PCBs for bluetooth applications that included the integration of peripheral devices with various communication protocols (SPI, I2C, UART). These projects were done by me end-to-end; I completed design, layout, parts and fabrication, soldering and verification.

I have 2 years experience developing firmware for embedded applications in C/C++. Projects I have worked on include the flight control for an autonomous quadcopter and a basketball shot tracker that used a microcontroller, light sensors, accelerometer and bluetooth to transmit makes and misses to an iPhone application.

I have 3 years of experience developing hardware applications using system verilog for FPGA. Projects I have worked on included an image processor that identified and localized a beacon object using HDMI and 1080p 30Hz video on a Xilinx FPGA, a radiation-hardened microprocessor that can boot linux, and a simple scalar processor with a microcode engine.

I have 4 years of experience developing C/C++ applications for general computation and algorithms. My current research project, PaMul, segments C/C++ programs into tasks using the LLVM API and observes communication patterns between these tasks. I built an autonomous trading machine that used the TWS API and C++ to process input financial data, generate price signals, and place orders on live financial markets, and I contributed to OpenXML, an open-source backend graphics project that aims to generalize the vector graphics API of modern OpenGL backends.","Scottsdale, United States","March 3, 2022",$50,0.0,0.0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

I started out as a DJ years ago and migrated into audio production and engineering. I decided to couple that knowledge with video editing in order to provide my clients with the best of both worlds. Providing quality content with quick turnarounds, no matter the budget. Whether you need a simple video/photo album, highlight reel, corporate presentation, or special event (i.e.weddings, graduations, etc.).

Lastly, I do not charge for reasonable revisions after I deliver the 1st cut of existing footage/content of your project. I will only charge for revisions that are added which were not a part of the original scope of work.

For example: if you want to “change” a font, color, size, location of assets/elements etc, I won’t charge you for that after the delivery of the 1st cut. However, if you want to “add” additional elements/content etc., I will bill for that time needed to incorporate the additional item(s) into the project. I do not charge for the actual stock footage, images, elements, or music used in your project (all copyright/royalty free) that I provide but will bill you for the time spent on searching for what you will ultimately approve.

My rate is $35/hr and it includes adding titles, lower 3rds, motion graphics/animation, SFX, color grading/correction, or audio mixing/enhancements. Of course this is just a baseline and there are many variables that will may make your project more or less expensive.

You have a project and you need a Web Developer that can work on your project. 

And here's the kicker, your project may need a specific skillset like: - Front End (HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS, Bootstrap) Or... Maybe you need a blend of skills like Django and Python for Back End, Front End (Or React Front End) Etc. It's hard to find a person who can specialize in both FrontEnd and BackEnd. Most times you find a person who specializes in one or the other and then you need to find a second developer to get your project done.

 However... you're in luck because you just found a one-stop-shop! 

Hi! My name is David and I’m a Career Web Developer with over 4 years of experience. I've worked on everything from Small Web Apps for businesses to Enterprise Sized Web Platforms for major companies. As you can see I don't just work with WordPress. My expertise is pretty extensive. See our full list of development below: 
- WordPress 
- Javascript 
- HTML & CSS
- ReactJS

In closing... If you have a project, even if it's in the beginning phases of discovery, let's talk! I can help you flush out the details so that you can build the application you deserve. And if you're looking for a Developer who can get the project done, on-time, and done right from the start, contact me.

BACKGROUND: I started working as a software engineer in a start-up - where I was involved in the full development cycle from the scratch. After two years in that job, the project was delivered and I moved on as a freelancer and worked for local clients for about five years. I’m now starting my own company and focus on working full time on select interesting projects available on the PeoplePerHour platform.

QUALITY: To ensure the highest quality standards, we follow the software test lifecycle in parallel to the software development lifecycle. Strategically placing test conditions to determine all major components of the system are working as expected. Running ad-hoc manual checks along with sophisticated automated bots going through the entire application on daily basis covering all areas hard to cover by humans on daily basis. This state-of-the-art quality process delivers the finest quality product for our clients at an affordable rate due to the price saved by employing bots to cover regression runs.

DELIVERABLES: My areas of expertise include full-stack development in React/Node JS along with strong infrastructure setup and maintenance.

What you can expect from me:
* Clear communication during each phase of the project
* Upfront transparency on deliverables and deadlines
* Professional approach
* Development with quality in mind from day one

Maybe it's lack of time or lack of want that you are faced with when dealing with your books. Let's chat! I absolutely love bookkeeping! I am a neat freak about organization and details! I have years of experience under my belt - all different aspects - all of which link to being a helper to business owners.

Here are a few skills I've picked up along life's way:

- Business management and ownership, including accounting, bookkeeping, payroll, invoicing, inventory management, employee management (teenagers at that!)

- Computer software programs such as Quickbooks, Wave, Microsoft Works programs, SimplifyEm, ProSeries, Mint, and more! I taught myself how to work with HTML at one point (it was a long summer for my 13-year-old self) - I can jump in and learn just about any program you need me to!

- Taxes! I may be the oddball out here, but I love working with taxes! I can help get you going on sales tax, payroll tax, income tax, etc.

- Having a desire to be an asset and a help to others. I have 15+ years of experience in ministry working with children, teens, and their parents! That alone taught me what it takes to really see a person's need and getting in there to help solve it.

- Being available to help. What makes me stand out from the rest is that I solely base my business on relationships and trust. I want you, the business owner, to feel confident that you are working with the right person in the right time! I am not just another bookkeeper behind a computer screen. I want to be an asset to you and your company.


If you've made it this far, let's get together to talk about your business needs/goals and what I can do to help you meet those! I am all about chasing my dreams by helping you chase your own! I offer full-charge bookkeeping services (includes accounts payable, accounts receivable, bank reconciliations, transaction coding, Balance Sheets, Income Statements, etc.), QuickBooks and Wave setups and tutorials, payroll, and one-time books cleanups.

Hi and welcome. If you don't already know, I am an avid knowledge seeker and an enthusiastic programmer. I grew up programming with Windows Batch when I was about 11. I created little text-based games and started learning how software was created. As I became older I dived into Python and took some classes at the end of my senior year of high school.

I've graduated with a B.S. in Information Science and Technology. I've worked for USGS as a contractor for 1.5 years and have been a software developer for the past 6 years. I am well versed in Full Stack Development via Drupal as well as C# in Windows Applications and Unity Game Development.

It's not all about coding and I think for you to understand what kind of person I am, you need to know more than just my skills. I love going kayaking, hiking, weekend camping in the Mark Twain National Forest, and cooking meals beyond ramen noodles. I strive to better myself and those around me so it's my hope that you will see the dedication I have.","Kansas City, United States","June 9, 2020",$25,0.0,0.0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

I genuinely love helping entrepreneurs and businesses build kick-ass software products to grow their businesses!

After a successful 10-year career building and launching consumer software products, I started the agency Valere Labs — a team of highly talented engineers, digital strategists, designers and QA engineers that are experts in:
✔ iPhone (Swift), Android (Kotlin & Java)
✔ React Native, Flutter
✔ AngularJS, ReactJS,
✔ Python, NodeJS, PHP, Django,, Laravel, Ruby on Rails, MongoDB.

Throughout my career I worked with five different software development agencies. Each agency had sub-par processes and lacked clear communication. Because I had launched several successful software products and observed issues from agencies and in-house software teams, I wanted to build the ultimate software agency that could create high performance web and mobile apps more efficiently and economically. So I did just that with Valere Labs...

High-level process building web and mobile apps at Valere Labs:
For each software project we go through a Discovery Phase with the client to get an in-depth understanding of the product we are building. We work with the client to develop low-fidelity mockups, flow diagrams, and rules to describe how the software will work. After the user experience is designed, we extract all of the individual “user stories” into a spreadsheet that describes every product use case. This process of identifying and articulating each “user story” meticulously ultimately ensures our vision for the application aligns with the clients before we write any code.

After the Discovery Phase, we enter the Build Phase. During this phase several Software Developers, a Project Manger, a UI Designer and our Quality Assurance team are assigned to your project. All members use the spreadsheet with “user stories” as a guide, knocking off each “user story” one-by-one.

The Project Manager articulates each “user story” to the Software Developer, and upon completion, the Quality Assurance team will then test that “user story” across several devices/browsers. Once all “user stories” are completed in a sprint/milestone, the client is able to test and provide feedback. We replicate this process for each sprint/milestone until the project is complete.

Within this high level process there are many sub-processes we perform to ensure success in terms of how we do research, review code, comment code, share updates with clients, etc. I believe our strong portfolio is a reflection of Valere Labs bullet proof software process.

Thanks for your interest in Valere Labs and reading this far :) Would love to learn about your project to see if we can be a good fit.","Marlborough Ma, United States","March 10, 2021",$50,0.0,0.0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

It's not about them, it's about YOU and YOUR audience. So yes, I have a business degree, a master in marketing, won international tech contests and +7 years of corporate experience. But who cares about me when I want to get to know YOU and YOUR business? Your ""WHY""?

I studied computer science and mathematics and I find that having a strong theoretical grasp of software aids me tremendously in avoiding pitfalls and dealing with hard problems. I've been programming since I was 12 and I genuinely enjoy it. I particularly enjoy working on diverse projects and learning new technologies.

My previous job gave me experience working with both manually-entered data and data collected by scientific instruments and I learned to consolidate, clean, and interpret this data. This is something my math background helped with, though to be honest not as much as knowing python's pandas library. I also learned the value of clean code and a sane development and production environment there, primarily because when I arrived such an environment was lacking.

The past five years in full-time freelance have really honed my expertise in Motion Graphics, where I've animated everything from movie bumpers to explainer videos to special FX, and everything in between. I've even taken on an adjunct teaching position at Chapman University in the graphic design department.

I also have extensive 3D experience in Maya for both games and pre-rendered quality assets. For the work I did in advertising, I was the full production coordinator. I did everything from design to modeling, animation, final rendering and compositing, etc.

With my degree in Computer Animation and a minor in Digital Film, I learned not only the software, but I got a solid foundation in traditional arts. The many entertainment genres I've studied or worked in make me versatile enough to handle polished corporate work, story-driven animation, game-ready video game assets, or even live-action visual effects.

A single video may impact millions of people around the world, videos tell stories in ways that text alone cannot touch. If you are not using videos (or are misusing them), then I’m here to help as a creative video editor.

You know that you want to reach your audience, to get yourself and your story heard and seen – because your story is unique and you have something to say. Your story deserves better than plug and cut auto video software, better than cookie cutter. I offer individually tailored videos that speak to your audience about your story.

You have the footage, but not a video (or a bad one), it can certainly feel like you have a mountain to move with stitching it all together into a quality edited video. I can turn your raw footage into a personally crafted video, efficiently and without hassle, and without the headache!

Creating videos that impact people is something that motivates me in life. It can certainly be a challenge to find the footage, B-roll, effects, music, and graphic combinations to make that perfect video. Yet much like completing a hard-sought goal, it ends up becoming something amazing with a creative and perseverant mind.

Your story could be about you, your business, a project, a product, or most anything else – if you need your story told in an engaging video that is enjoyable and memorable, then you’ve come to the right place!

*** Better Research = Better Strategy = More Leads = More Revenue ***

Have you been struggling to optimize your website for your goals? Maybe you want to increase your sales OR conversions but cannot *crack the code*. 

Through the framework I follow, I will help you identify the areas of improvement to start making more money and getting more customers with your website.

A bit about me: 

- Over 10 years of digital marketing experience
- Over 2 years of funnel optimization experience
- Satisfaction GUARANTEED 

Whether you need ;
- CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization)
- Landing Page Optimization
- Landing Page Building
- Email Marketing Optimization
- Traffic Optimization
- User Experience Research

A refined conversion framework can earn you more conversions & money within 24 hours!

Let me share with you the framework that I've been using successfully: 

Step 1: Observation (identifying where to focus by using analytics data)
Step 2: Research (identifying the 'why' behind user behavior by doing user surveys and sometimes interviews)
Step 3: Ideation (looking for ideas to solve the why through brainstorming and external research)
Step 4: Hypothesize (building a test hypothesis for the suggested optimization based on past testing benchmarks, industry benchmarks or experience)
Step 5: Roadmap (putting the optimization on the product/website roadmap)
Step 6: Wireframe (creating a wireframe for the idea)
Step 7: Design UI + Prototype (having a designer prepare a design based on the wireframe)
Step 8: Usability Test (Run the UI's in [login to view URL]. to identify usability issues)
Step 9: Value Test (live testing - a/b most often in google optimize OR other testing tool)
Step 10: Analyze (""this happened""..""here is why""..""moving forward""..)
Step 11: Spec + Documentation (full spec for engineers to implement sitewide the ""winner"" of the experiment, if there is one)
Step 12: Release (the optimization is released to the wild)
Step 13: Usability test (again)
Step 14: Evangelize (make sure the internal team knows about the optimization)
Step 15: Re-Analyze (""this happened""..""here is why""..""moving forward""..)
Step 16: Re-start from step 1

Generally speaking, I like to work based on this schedule (more or less).

Week 1 - Complete steps 1-6
Week 2 - Complete steps 7 & 8
Week 3/4 - Complete step 9
Week 5 - Complete steps 10 & 11
Week 6 - Complete steps 12-14
Week 7/8 - Complete step 15 less

 **************

I want anyone who hires me to know first and foremost - my work brings me joy. 

Above my desk hangs my first ever original story, written on a typewriter at age 4. It is about a skeleton and a bat fighting. When I was 8, I met Lavar Burton because I won the Reading Rainbow fiction contest. I helped form the Worldbuilding Zine on Reddit.

 I LOVE WRITING. And I am told that I'm not half bad at it. 

Some other things. 

As a young boy in the 90's my friends found a Dragon Ball Z fan site that had these short animations of a character shooting an energy beam from his hands. He told me he wanted to make something like that for us, where we could make the characters to even COOLER things than that. I had to go home, but I asked ""Can I sleepover next weekend?"". 

After I left his house, I took a bus to the bookstore, and spent every penny I had left on 3 books: One on Website Building, Flash, the other on Game Programming. (The kind that even came with the CD!)

I read them all that week, or the parts that I needed anyway. He got grounded the following weekend, so luckily, I had more time. But the next time we saw eachother...

You'd have thought two pixel art characters duking it out in the Geocities Square Garden was Bruce Lee vs. Mike Tyson. 

This endeavor was hard for me, I'm not a math person by nature. I'm an artist, in truth. But, I thrive on discovery, interactivity, and accomplishment.

-----------

Here's the boring list of things I can do. I'd rather you focus on the above, but I get it.

======================

Skilled in the Following Software
-------------------------------------------------
All Adobe Suite (Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere Pro, Animate, etc.)
Aseprite and MANY other Pixel Art Utilities
Microsoft Suite (Powerpoint, Word, Excel)
R, Markdown, Latex
Google Suite (Just like Microsoft) but BETTER, because...
I also know Google Apps Code.

Web Langauges
-------------------------
HTML, PHP, CSS, SASS, SCSS, JavaScript, JSON.
Plus, many, MANY of the popular frameworks - but NOT REACT. I will not work on Facebook technologies. It's not the framework itself, it's privacy related.

Programming Languages
-----------------------------
My Best: Python, Lua, JavaScript, Actionscript

Game Development
-------------------------------
Game Maker Studio (GML)
Love2D 
Pico-8 (and many other Fantasy Consoles!)
Phaser
and so many others I can't start to name.

I am also certified in Zoho, Zoho Analytics, SalesForce, and HubSpot with user knowledge of Fresh applications. In addition, I have developed business processes as well as workflows and blueprints. My most recent project was as a consultant responsible for setting up Zoho CRM for the B2B division of a Global Hardware Corporation. Key responsibilities: Establish a scope of work describing my role in the ground up design including workflows and blueprints, educating the assigned administrator as well as the sales team, developing a training program designed to allow new hires to step through each customized module and rule designed specifically for the client. Training was also designed to be a self led or instructor led reference and tool along with simple videos to be used as refreshers. In addition, the client wanted to integrate their ERP system (Revenue reporting) with Zoho to be able to have every order and invoice automatically input into the CRM. Using API's and the Zoho Analytics platform, I was able to provide the integration, build dashboards, and provide visual drill downs of the layers of data to allow for finite analysis and trending. The data analysis is being used to develop more accurate and seasonal spend on inventory, detailed buyer profiles for segmentation, and geographic attributes.

I have spent the last 10 years focusing on the impact and uses cases for sales, marketing, product, finance, inventory management using automation technology to improve productivity and to have access to the data necessary to win. I would be delighted to share my experience with your company and to provide you with my strong base of knowledge to insure your long term success.

software engineer,Samuel M.,https://www.freelancer.com/u/muldoonsamuel,"Computer Usability, Design, & English Editing","In general, I work to make tools easier to use. For example, a good website will allow a person to enter a date in many different formats. The computer might accept dots (11.27.2020), and accept slashes (11/27/2020), accept dashes (11-27-2020) and any other delimiter. A website which forces you to re-type ""11/27/2020"" as ""11-27-2020"" is a badly designed website.

While I was a college student, I wrote computer programs in more than seven languages: Python, Java, C, C++, R, Matlab, Intel x86 Assembly language. I graduated in 2017 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics.

I was one of the editors of my high school's newspaper: ""The Medallion."" My SAT score was in the 95 percentile for critical reading. In November of 2016, I scored 98% on the verbal reasoning section of the GRE.

I look forward to improving both your computer software and your English writing.

I participated in several projects from small to large corporations, where I started as a Data Center Operator at TIM Italia in Brazil (the largest mobile operator at the time) and had my first contact with Digital Unix, Solar, FreeBSD, Linux and Microsoft, since then I'm obsessed with the idea of using more cloud software to solve practical problems. Software engineering is an endless puzzle that I am passionately involved in solving. I believe in the power of programming to transform and improve people's lives around the world.

Throughout my professional career I have always stood out for my desire and constant search for improvement, with this I had several opportunities to join and participate in wonderful projects, where I could contribute and learn at the same time. In the evolution of my career, I had the opportunity to lead teams focused on cloud deployment, IoT and software development. And in a second moment, I found myself able to manage my own business, hiring professionals and putting together a team of 23 employees where we provide technical support services for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, routers, cloud and software and apps development. Today, in search of new achievements, I moved to North America and started a FreeLance career on the online platforms. More recently, I founded Krinski Corporation in search of new opportunities in America.

software engineer,Harold M.,https://www.freelancer.com/u/hal07843,Software Engineer and Academic or Technical Editor,"In a brief summary, I have been a software engineer (C/UNIX/Linux/Perl/Python/PHP/MySQL/Amazon+eBay SDKs) for many years.

I also have the verbal ability and broad knowledge to be a academic editor, helping non-native English writers, and a scientific/technical writer. I also love working with people, especially in a helping role, such as in editing.

 (1) SOFTWARE ENGINEER
I have programmed in Perl for 25 years, about as long as it has existed. My business, a book store, runs on Perl, Apache, PHP, MySQL, Javascript and Amazon and eBay SDKs. It serves web pages adapted to an Android phone for inventory, and taking new pictures and uploading them into the system on the spot.

In Perl, I developed a kernel crash analyzer with auto-analysis of the stack and instant access to all source. I presented a course in England on this analyzer to other UNIX support people.

I have intermediate skills in Python, and have worked through a Flask tutorial by Miguel Grinberg which produces a really sophisticated micro-blog site, and am porting my business software to Python.

I spent 20 years as a software engineer, first at Bell Labs, notably writing a simulator, compiler, and well-received manual for a DSP microprocessor with floating point in C. It simulated reading and writing individual pins each clock cycle. I enjoyed, and was good at user support. I also found and fixed many bugs in the UNIX kernel.

I run a non-business Wordpress website.

 (2) WRITER, TECHNICAL AND ACADEMIC EDITOR
I have worked as an editor in academic and technical subjects, with non-native English writers on many topics, some listed below. To deal with these topics, I needed a rough understanding of technical terms and how they fit together, which I could generally find in Wikipedia.

Human Sciences:
* The book: Psychosyntax: The Nature of Grammar and its Place in the Mind, published by Springer-Verlag in 2017.
* Two books on specialized early 19c history topics: slavery, abolition, and women's rights.
* An article on Cultural Evolution debating how well it fits into a Darwinian framework.

Computer Science:
* New ranking methods for modern supercomputer architectures.
* Multi-channel speech enhancement using machine learning
* Topics in mobile robotics
* Network repair protocol for self-organizing radio networks (cognitive radio)

Biological/medical
* Renal cell cilia deformations
* Machine Learning enhanced X-Rays.

Engineering
* Earthquake resistant architecture
* 1923 Tokyo earthquake landscape structural analysis
* Petrochemical exploration

Physics
* Generation of a type of hydrogen ionic plasma
* Crystallography
* Semi-fluidity

I also have an MS in Mathematics from OSU.

I was a paid guest contributer on [login to view URL] with two articles:
* ""Cannon Balls, Plate Tectonics, and Invisible Elephants"": a breezy miniature portrait of the nature of science.
* ""From Monkey Neurons to the Meta-Brain"" on the evolution and nature of ""ultra-social"" traits of human beings.","Hopatcong, United States","October 31, 2019",$40,0.0,0.0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

I take the wealth of knowledge and experience from my military training and tours of duty around the world, coupled with my expertise in management of various government contracts and services, to continue serving humanity through the power of the written word.

My writing skills were honed at an early age, as even in childhood, and long before Google, I felt naturally compelled to search the dictionary or encyclopedia to learn the meaning of words, terms and phrases, to have a thorough understanding of what I was reading or writing about. I was and still remain keenly aware of the value and importance of words being used in the proper context of the meaning and message intended.
 
My first 7 years in the Air Force as a Fireman provided a plethora of exhilarating and profound experiences. However, after cross-training, over my remaining 13 years as an Engineering Technician, I further honed my writing skills reviewing and developing contract documents for government construction projects and professional service agreements. 

Following my career in the military, I spent the next 21 years in Civil Service working as a Professional Services Contract Manager and Contract Compliance Administrator; where I was provided a broad range of opportunities to continue perfecting my writing skills within the professional engineering services environment.

Since then I have been able to apply my creative skills in many different ways: as an editor, blogger or copywriter. But it was only when I started working with other people that I realized how rewarding this work could be.

Working on so many exciting projects has helped me develop new skills and widen the scope of what is possible - both creatively and commercially. It’s also led to some of my most memorable achievements, including the white papers for a new cryptocurrency launch, of which I’ve just completed a first draft.

As far as career highlights, I’ve been with Flocksy (creative agency) for the last ten months. My time there helped me grow in so many ways – as an individual, as well as professionally.

""Transforming Ideas To Reality!""

That has been the slogan which I have lived by since I set out on my own as a freelance graphic designer. The line rings just as true today as it did in 2013 when I began Lite Graphic Solutions. My core belief was that everyone should have the opportunity to look their best in their chosen careers. Whether you are a business which has been established for years and is looking to freshen up appearances or an entrepreneur trying to make your startup operational, there's no reason why you can't have branding that's on par with that of a Fortune 500 company.

My graphic design portfolio ([login to view URL]) provides a wide sampling of some of the work I have created for clients who have entrusted me with helping them put their best foot forward as they grow their businesses. The industries which they cover from read like a station list for a cable package, but despite their diversity they all have in common that need for a good, solid branding of their products and services which are universal for success:

- Logos
- Business Cards
- Stationary
- Brochures
- Flyers
- Websites
- Promotional Items
- Social Media
- Advertising
- Brand Identity

All of these and more I am able to provide for clients, in a timely manner and with good communication. If you're in need of any of these items, send me a message. Whether you have a general idea of what you are wanting or if you are starting from scratch, I'll be happy to help you look good!","Sacramento, United States","May 16, 2021",$20,0.9,5.0,1,0,100,N/A,100,N/A

Hey there! For those of you who do not know me, my name is Nicholas. I am an Electrical Engineering Consultant, and I have something really important that I want to share with you today.

For most of you reading this, hiring an electrical engineering freelancer or contractor has been a struggle to say the least. You have likely lost a great deal of money only to receive a sub-marginal product. Constant change orders, redraws, slow work, missed deadlines, failing “cross-functional” teams, no quality assurance, and huge bills are just a few examples. I would imagine that you are feeling very frustrated, confused, and maybe even a little humiliated. Does this sound about right? You are correct to be worried, because many people get screwed over when they hire an engineering contractor.

But what if I told you there is one thing, just one thing you could do to flip the script? It is as easy as sending me a message on Freelancer.

I am an American entrepreneur, electrical engineer, and trusted consultant. I am an accomplished expert with nearly a decade of experience in the electrical engineering industry. As a knowledgeable professional with experience in the nuclear industry, I have had serious involvement with numerous quality-dependent, critical power and control systems. Within five years of graduating from the prestigious Clarkson University with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Electrical Engineering, in addition to minors in both Computer Science and Mathematics, I obtained experience at a multinational technology company and also rapidly became a trusted, lead analytical engineer at Indian Point Energy Center. Today, I help individuals and entrepreneurs maximize their profits by increasing their technical expertise.

Now, security audits are also available for many areas ranging from simple source code audits to full blown ""Black Hat"" pen-tests. During these premium tests, typically all that is given to me is your companies URL. I will then preform reconnaissance on your websites and servers, learning as much as I can about your site and company using the same public and private tools that a malicious attacker will have access to. Your servers will then be checked with a wide range of scans and manual checks looking for both known and unknown security issues. Typically, about 90% of systems tested can be penetrated. All client information is kept strictly confidential, and any materials obtained during said tests are promptly destroyed. NDAs can be signed as needed.

With that large of an audience, maximizing your business or organization’s awareness on social media is a MUST!

However, for many professionals, it can be frustrating create eye-catching and trendy graphics for potential customers when you have other business-related projects to worry about.

That’s where I come in! I specialize in creating professional, high-quality social media graphics for individuals, start-up, and established businesses. Using Adobe Create Suite® software, I create customized and tailored graphics that enhance your social media profiles, while configuring each graphic to work with each platform’s algorithms.

I can provide social media graphics that are:
► visually stunning and trendy,
► consistent with your brand for the best audience engagement,
► optimized for each social media platform’s algorithm,
► automatically scheduled (with content) onto your profiles, and
► configured via metric analysis for improvements to future graphics.

I am well-rounded in graphic designing for Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube. I also have many previous clients (working with a graphic design company) who were primarily start-up to small businesses. Some had no social media profiles whatsoever, and some had every one you could think of! 

Whether you are an individual, a start-up, or an established business, I would love to have the honor of designing your social media platforms","Akron, United States","November 10, 2021",$12,0.0,0.0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

My path to where I am now started early, with a camping trip when I was six. Through camping and hiking trips, and experiences that can only be found off the well-beaten track, I fell in love with nature and my desire to protect it was born. I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Renewable Energy in order to learn and understand how renewable technologies were designed, developed, and installed. I then pursued my Master’s in Natural Resources and Energy Policy, so I know not only how renewables work physically, but also socially. 

I am a forever learner, always ready for a challenge and the ever-changing landscape of energy. I am searching for a position in renewable energy, energy efficiency, cleantech, or energy policy; the specific field is less important to me than the group and community I am a part of. 

Of the various types of renewable energies, I am well-versed with wind, solar, and geothermal, with less but still substantial understanding of oceanic energies, smart and efficient building design, and storage. I am also highly competent at the analysis of law and policy, especially in regards to energy. In analyzing and developing energy and various other projects, I have developed skills of laboratory safety, iterative design, and community outreach, as well as used programs such as ArcGIS, HOMER, SAM, SolidWorks, and OpenLCA. I have also been involved with multiple coding languages, such as python/jython, MATLAB, LabVIEW, and LaTeX.

My name is Phil Tendler and I would love the opportunity to work with you on your project! My company name is California Printing Co. I have an extensive resume which I’d like to share with you.

I have 27 years of professional design experience with all relative software and up to date on all current versions: Adobe Creative Cloud 2021: Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Acrobat Pro; QuarkXpress, etc. I am an excellent speller, proofreader, and can correct grammar. This is a courtesy benefit I offer to my customers (though the final proofing is up to the client). 

I offer a full range of printing services by working with over 80 superb vendors. You can print full color, short-run digital, higher quality digital, or brilliant offset printing; everything from 1 to 8 color: CMYK + spot colors. Paper coating, embossing, foil stamping, and die-cutting are just a few of the bindery services I offer. I print everything from corporate identities, flyers and brochures to bottle labeling; even very intricate projects, such as quadruple die-cut and glued, 64pt. black cover stock, Oscar Academy “FYC” sets with inserted Blu-Rays. Fully custom packaging design/printing is another one of my specialties. When the customer requires eco-friendly materials such as recycled paper stock and soy-based inks, I always accommodate their needs.

I do large format printing such as banners, trade show displays, full booths, large floor stickers, auto wraps, signs, and much more.

I specialize in promotional products: branded items for events, recruitment, or giveaways (i.e. mugs, pens/stylus, USB drives, journals, awards, bags, apparel, keychains, screen cloths, power banks, 2,000,000 more products, and of course – custom products)!

I utilize a full range of apparel decorations such as silk screen, embroidery, or unique fashion treatments such as logos made out of six sizes of rhinestones! Intel, Yahoo!, and Zumba are just a few of the high-profile companies I have worked with for many years and done these shirts for, and have received 5-star reviews from all of them!

I’ve done virtual mock-ups for NBA teams (one of which is the NBA champions Phoenix Suns) and put them into a classy presentation format. I give them product ideas when they don’t ask for specific items or know exactly what they want.

I know everything about the prepress process and can set up your job for press – 100% perfectly! I work hand-in-hand with my customers to produce a job that they are thrilled with by taking it from concept to completion. I am highly adept at typography and matching it to your design. This will give you a beautiful, one-of-a-kind piece of artwork, printed job, promotional product(s), or apparel.

When designing art for the web, I create pixel-perfect requested d.p.i files, which I provide to my very talented web, UX/UI, and mobile phone designers.

I very much look forward to hearing from you and I thank you for reading this! Have a wonderful day!","Southwick, United States","May 23, 2021",$65,0.0,0.0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Thanks for taking a moment to read my profile. It can be difficult selecting among a never-ending stream of resumes featuring people you've never met. After proposal #5, they all start to sound the same.

My main strengths are SEO and web development. Specifically I'm partial to WordPress. 

Responsive design is crucial. Over 50% of all web traffic comes from mobile devices. In North America, it's over 60%.

I have experience performing application, systems, network, wireless, physical and hardware based security assessments and have kept my CISSP current since 2011. In addition to traditional IT infrastructure and devices I've also done considerable work with OT systems including ICS, SCADA and SmartGrid.

I've been working in the security field for over 15 years across a number of verticals including biopharma, utilities, finance and state and federal government.

I've earned my Bachelors in Information Technology with a concentration in Internetworking from Rochester Institute of Technology, a Masters in Telecommunications with a concentration in Security from Boston University, and a second Masters in Computer Science also with a concentration in Security from Boston University. I've additionally earned certificates in Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity also from Boston University. While attending Boston University I also performed paid security research, helped develop security modules for a number of online courses and stood up an online collaboration platform for virtual classrooms.

My goal in performing security assessment work is to provide more insight than what a simple vulnerability scan can. I can go deeper, stringing vulnerabilities together across multiple domains and developing custom proof-of-concept exploits to add impact to known vulnerabilities.

Lastly, I present well and am comfortable providing professionally written reports as well as presenting to various levels of audiences including upper management.","Baltimore, United States","September 3, 2021",$50,0.0,0.0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

I'm very passionate on what I do, and 3D is my profession. I studied visual arts and developed my skills as a creator of tridimensional objects since very early in my formation. 

Having specialized in Digital Sculpture for organic objects, and Parametric software of CAD for precise prototyping of functional objects as well, the software I use ranges from Pixologic Zbrush to Dassault Systèmes Solidworks.

I work from my 3D printing studio where I have many 3D FFF and DLP printers working to help professionals on their projects. 

I believe that best way to create is to know what the public and clients need, what they want to express and how any medium will convey all this information in the best possible way, a 3D object, a character, a logo, an animation, or a video are some of the best options to answer these needs.

Please feel free to message me for any questions.

I will be glad to work with you and create long term working relationships.

software engineer,Justin S.,https://www.freelancer.com/u/jsousa1919,Full Stack Engineer focused on web services.,"Hi, I'm Justin,

I'm a software engineer who at the moment specializes in web development, whether it's building an interactive user interface, writing the server application and APIs that make it run. I've spent the last decade working with startups and small businesses building websites and business applications.

I recently decided to bring my experience into the startup community as well. I began my professional career as a software developer but I've spent these years also learning a great deal about business, sales, and web design, and would like to bring all that I've learned out there to help you while I build my new business as a full-time freelance web developer.

I joined Bombfell, an online personal styling service for men, as the first full-stack engineer working side-by-side with the CTO. At that time the company was no more than the founders and a handful of stylists working together out of a small apartment. Starting with an AWS hosted python server, a MySQL database, and a front-end built on AngularJS which we later changed to React.js, over the next six years we continuously built and upgraded the public website, internal portals for stylists to shop and communicate with customers, as well as integrated billing, shipping, and inventory management systems. Together, we acquired series A funding and expanded our technical team from the CTO and I to a team of full-stack engineers, designers, and data scientists. As our team grew I learned more about the responsibilities necessary in leading project development as well as the tools that could be used to streamline development and testing processes. By the time I left, Bombfell had grown to include hundreds of stylists nationwide with a large number of devoted customers.

More recently, I served as the first and lead engineer at the recently-founded MeetGerry, which aims to pair individuals seeking long-term residential care with their ideal care facilities. Here, I took over the reigns from an outsourced development crew that had created a small public website built with an out-of-date version of Ruby on Rails hosted on servers outside of our control. My first step was to re-implement the website with an identical but more functional python Pyramid server on AWS with a postgresql database. Using React.js for the front-end and more mobile friendly CSS, I expanded the existing site and added an easily customized sign-up system for new clients in addition to creating an internal portal to assist in marketing and customer development. With automated development and testing processes in hand, I brought onboard a data scientist, designer, and another full-stack engineer to continue to grow MeetGerry and later pivot into the next iteration of the company, GerryCare.

Thank you for your time in reading this and all the best,

Hello,
My name is Hossein and I'm 22 years old. Currently attending Berkeley. I've self-taught my self everything that I learned about web design since middle school. I have experience designing websites and blogs with Joomla, WordPress, Wix, and Squarespace. I DO NOT DO THIS AS A PROFESSION! I do this as a hobby in my free time :)

I personally recommend Squarespace and Wix to most people for websites, since it's easy to design and most of the functions that you need are already pre-built into the software and very easy to manage on your own. 

For hosting, I definitely recommend GoDaddy, can't go wrong with that.

Representative patent applications, both pending and granted, are listed in the following link: [login to view URL]

Ash is a partner at Lipton, Weinberger & Husick. Ash has significant experience in trademark filing and trademark prosecution. Drafted and filed more than 700 patent applications and more than 500 trademark applications. He has obtained about 500 patents for my clients.

Ash Tankha has filed patent applications in different domains such as software, business methods, mechanical, electronic communication and semiconductors, chemical, pharmaceutical and biotechnology with the US Patent and Trademark Office and other foreign patent offices (through foreign associates). You may contact Ash for references.

Prior to filing a patent application, an extensive prior art search is conducted over various databases to determine if the concept of the invention is novel. The patent application is consequently filed with the US patent office after the client has approved of the same.

If the search result indicates that the inventive concept is novel and may contain patentable subject matter, a draft of the patent application is prepared for filing with the U.S.PTO. 

Once the draft of the patent application is prepared, the draft of the application is sent to the client for the client's review and comments. Once the application is approved by the client for filing, the patent application is filed with the U.S.PTO or the appropriate foreign patent office.

Ash files responses to office actions issued by the U.S.PTO for patent applications under examination. Often, inventors receive an office action, for example an objection or rejection of a claim from the US Patent and Trademark Office, for which the patent attorney prepares the responses and optionally interviews the U.S.PTO patent examiners to advance the prosecution of the application.

Ash provides services for clients both nationally and internationally in patent related matters in diverse areas of technology. 

For patent or trademark inquiries, please call: Ash Tankha, Patent Attorney, Lipton, Weinberger & Husick.

He founded the company in April 2017 and is forming other companies on the side as he works on building his own label. Under the company, he retains his rights to all of his creative works through his direct deals with BMI, Soundexchange, and Sentric Music (Ingrooves), which he signed in 2015. Through his connection base and research while attending Diablo Valley College, San Ramon and The University of California, Santa Cruz, God Sent Genius™ has carried a formidable network and has challenged the status quo year after year.

He began his journey and business building in 2011 at the age of 17 when he started a non profit media group called, ""No Established Culture™"", in Rocklin, CA.

In April 2014, he began networking with the staff of Universal Music Group, Def Jam, G.O.O.D. Music, and Roc Nation to learn Music Business while studying marketing/promotions with their A&R/Press Teams at Starlight PR. He retained his master use rights after his first single was released and has complete control over his company. Today, he keeps a rolodex of many influential contacts within the entertainment industry.

In September 2016, after a range of live performances at venues such as The House of Blues, Venue Oakland, Rain Nightclub, Blue Lamp Nightclub, The Dragonfly, and The New Parish, while releasing several now accessible mixtape releases, GSG™ began working on patenting a software/hardware design that is still a work in progress, Crowdsurf.Live™. He transferred to The University of California, Santa Cruz in 2018 and has remained focused on the success of the companies and all parties involved ever since. In the summer of 2021, GSG™️ contracted with BeatStars & Sony Music Publishing for the purpose of growing his business and establishing a solid presence within the Music Industry as both a producer and artist.

I love helping passionate founders build game-changing apps is what wakes me up in the morning! 

I built, raised capital for, and sold several consumer software products.

I've worked with off-shore agencies, freelancers, and I even hired my own in-house teams. I've seen what works and what doesn't. I've been through the struggle of working with untrustworthy developers who just want your money and don't care about the product. Thats why I wanted to ensure no one has to go through the same struggles I did so that's why I partnered with Valere Labs.

Valere Labs specializes in designing and developing award-winning mobile apps and websites that are fast, attractive, responsive, and easy to use. We've built over 100 successfully launched applications –ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies! Valere has experience developing for both consumer and B2B audiences across a myriad of verticals such as healthcare, finance, sports, fitness, education, and more!

 Valere is an agency consisting of highly talented engineers, digital strategists, designers, PMs, and QA engineers that are experts in: 
✔ iPhone (Swift), Android (Kotlin & Java) 
✔ React Native, Flutter, Iconic 
✔ AngularJS, ReactJS, Javascript, WordPress 
✔ Python, NodeJS, PHP, Django, Laravel, Ruby on Rails, MongoDB

 Valere Labs has re-invented how software agencies operate -- mitigating issues related to communication and process inefficiencies allowing us to attract the interest of enterprise and newly funded startups. Our project minimum is $10,000 USD which comes out to about ~200 hours worth of work.

If you are looking for quick, one-and-done projects, Valere is not the right firm for you. We take extended amounts of time to hear your entire vision and understand your customer, your market, your differentiating factors, and we build you a product that can be built on for the long run. We look at ourselves as a partner in your company. When we help you succeed, you will need more development work, and we will be right there with you every step of the way from MVP to IPO.

Simplicity of Message
Single-minded, not simpleminded. I am careful not to “sell my way out of dinner before receiving the invitation.” 

Truth in Advertising
Never blow smoke but tell the truth. It’s not a gimmick but will move people to trust you. Never exaggerate or the prospect will instantly question your credibility.

Repetition and Consistency
Repeated exposure to your prospects will embed your brand into their long-term memory. The lack of consistency risks missed opportunities. Visual consistency moves your brand from short-term memory to long-term awareness.

Disruption!
Be different. Safe ideas can kill you. If your message goes unnoticed, then everything else has been wasted. Let us develop brilliant concepts that capture imaginations.

*** Long version *** 

Personal life: My first encounter with CGI and VFX was in 1999 and the movie ""The Matrix"". Since then, I become obsessed with CGI and always wanted to create things I imagine in my mind. I'm graduating in Software Engineering but I wanna work in the CGI and VFX field in the near future. I would love to do freelancing. It will give me the options to choose and also I can meet a lot of people, know their needs and get things done as soon as possible with the highest quality imagined. I'm kind of a perfectionist in my life. I won't stop working on things till they are finished in the fashion I like them to be. Profession: I started learning 3d modeling in 2019. I started with Maya and after a while, I switched to Blender 3D. I keep learning stuff every day since then. The things I do mostly (till now) are 3D modeling, animation, texturing, and post-processing with either Blender or Davinci Resolve. At this point, I consider myself an intermediate in my area of work. The most important thing for me to work as a freelancer is having good communication with the employer so we could get things done in a good way. This way we can get top-notch results in very little time. I'm looking forward to work with you :)","Houston, United States","April 5, 2021",$8,4.3,5.0,8,0,100,100,100,67

MUSIC
I have over 20 years of experience in live performance as a drummer, acoustic guitarist, and lead vocalist. When the COVID-19 pandemic brought live performances to the brink of extinction, I began a journey in music on the recording side of the industry, focusing on music theory, production and engineering, and mixing.

software engineer,Jason T.,https://www.freelancer.com/u/JasonETorres,"Media developer, technologist, & problem solver.","Born and raised in New York City, getting his street smarts in The Bronx and his aesthetic sense on The Lower East Side, Jason played bass and guitar in several up and coming bands over the years before training as an audio engineer at NY’s Institute of Audio Research. Before even graduating, he jumped into the music production world, getting his start at Hot Sound, Unique Recording Studios, and Headrush Records where he got to experience the thrill of working in world class facilities with big name stars, while making great records. 

Making contacts quickly led to commissions from friends and acquaintances, and before long he was working steadily and in demand around New York’s vibrant music scene. He made friends in the film and video world, which led to contacts and work in advertising and even politics. After 20 great years in NYC, Jason left for warmer climate of Florida. Even after leaving NYC for sunny Tampa, Florida, Jason has been fortunate enough to continue working with great people, exciting projects, and amazing artists. 

Jason has been honored to work with top bands, international brands, and celebrities, as well as leading figures in the community. He is always excited when projects allow him to meet new people and travel to new places.","Valrico, United States","May 1, 2021",$25,0.0,0.0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

I have been programming since I was in high school and fell in love with industry because inherit need to be constantly learning and staying up to date. Just about all of the technologies I know are self taught. I feel I am able to gain a deeper understanding of the thing I am learning by simply messing around with it to see what works and what doesn't. Once I get to the point where I have that deep understanding of a technology, enjoy sharing what I have learned with others to help them with their projects. I am always willing to take on difficult problems that other may not. When solving these problems, I try to find ways to think outside of the box to create the best solution possible. I also make sure to design and implement solutions that follow the SOLID principles for the highest quality code. I have worked with many technologies over the years but my main strength is with the .NET stack. I am also proficient in other languages/technologies such as JavaScript, Angular, Python and Java to name a few. I am also proficient on the DevOps side of things with technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes and CI/CD pipelines.

software engineer,Clark G.,https://www.freelancer.com/u/WeaselWorks,WeaselWorks Freelance Editing,"Greetings, from Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA.

I look forward to applying my thirty-seven years of experience in proofreading, editing, copy editing, and writing to your Very Important Project (VIP).

I have a wide range of interests, including philosophy and the arts; history and social sciences; mathematics, technology and engineering; and medicine, biology, genetics, and other life sciences. I am also a voracious reader of sci-fi, fantasy, adventure, and all things Stephen King. I enjoy poetry and biographical works as well, and I am a serious reader of the King James Bible.

I am studious, knowledgeable, and have an expansive vocabulary, all traits of critical importance when the outcome of your VIP is on the line. Whether the subject is literary in nature, academic, technical, or business-oriented, I guarantee a working comprehension of your needs (or the ability to become versed in a matter of moments). Moreover, I promise to meet (or even exceed!) your expectations with regard to communication, and the successful completion of your VIP is a forgone conclusion – ""a result that can be predicted with certainty.""

Born and raised in the American Midwest, my native language is American English (AE). I am also quite fluent in British English (BE). In AE, my proficiency is of the highest level. Idioms, slang, and even most local variations come naturally to me.

I believe my greatest strengths as an editor are my attention to detail; my ability to discern your meaning and help you find a better (clearer, more concise, and therefore more dynamic) way to say it; and my ability to correctly employ grammar, spelling, and punctuation. I enjoy ""wordsmithing,"" sentence structure, and compositional editing, I excel at the intricacies of punctuation, and I thoroughly understand the rules of spelling and capitalization. I am ruthless on typos, and errors of all kinds virtually throw themselves at my feet. The grammatically incorrect know me only as ... Nemesis.

Having said that, I respectfully honor poetic license, and the author's voice always reigns supreme in the VIPs in my care. The customer's vision is at the forefront of my mind. If you need a piece thoroughly vetted, reviewed with a fine-tooth comb, edited or rewritten with precision – if you need a job done correctly, especially to a certain specification – I am the freelancer you're looking for.

Reverse Fall LLC is a Philadelphia-based design and development agency founded on the philosophy of 'Natural Design', where interacting with our software is natural to our end-users and understanding our designs feels second-nature.

We believe that by doing our part, we can set an example for other businesses and encourage a trend toward giving back to the world while continuing to innovate through technology.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
They were very prompt to answer my questions and provided me with social media posts always on time every month! We were very pleased!! Thank you!

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Isaac is a real pro, and a pleasure to work with. He did what he said he would in a timely and friendly manner, and even took it upon himself to offer me free advice on a range of other topics.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Isaac is a talented and excellent resource for social media content needs. He was prompt and professional. I highly recommend him to any business wanting to have social media presence on a scheduled basis. I will continue working with isaac for several businesses I operate.


⬇️ Experience ⬇️

Besides working with 150 brands managing their social media with this agency, I've worked at 3 different agencies where I sold and managed pretty much every type of media you can imagine. I also worked at two different companies in full time marketing roles, the last of which was a Silicone valley SAAS company where I managed a budget of more than $200K.

All of this varied experience makes me uniquely qualified to speak with just about any business and pretty quickly figure out where they should be putting marketing dollars for max efficiency.

I've worked with everything from starups to publicly traded companies. I love the challenges that come with both.

Here are some of the other industries I've worked in: manufacturing, hardware, non-profit, health and fitness, real estate, software, restaurants, education, medical, construction, training, photography, videography, events, and self help, and many more.

Brands that are typically not a good fit: Personal Brands or any brand that the founder essentially IS the brand (SOME realtors, most coaches, etc.)

software engineer,Ted M.,https://www.freelancer.com/u/tmiles56,Data Design & Programming,"With 20 years of experience in database design and programming, I have developed a comprehensive set of skills that enable me to create stable, flexible, user-friendly database applications with MS Access, MS SQL Server and Crystal Reports.

My MS Access experience covers everything from complex, multi-user distributed (front end - back end) applications, to quick, disposable, ad hoc utilities. I am proficient in Access SQL and VBA, so I am able to code complex business logic and create very intuitive, easily-navigated user interfaces. I also have extensive knowledge of Access ADP (Access front end, SQL Server back end) applications.

For my SQL Server clients, I can leverage the power of SQL Server by creating robust data processing resources. With advanced knowledge of the Transact SQL programming language, I'm able to create very user-friendly representations of complex data. With SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) I am able to automate a wide range of database operations, such as integrations and migrations.

I know how to make Crystal Reports shine as a report writing tool, by off-loading the data processing tasks to the underlying DBMS (database management system). The result is a fast, light weight and easily maintained Crystal Report. 

As a data modeler, I know how to design flexible data structures that can handle changing and expanding business requirements. I use ERwin data modeling software to design, analyze, prototype and document database resources.

Follow up support for my client is something I take very seriously. The manner in which I design and document a project enables me to quickly provide technical support and revisions, even after years of separation from the project. My work and availability schedule is very flexible and accommodating. Numerous references and samples of my work are available upon request. A full guarantee accompanies all of my work, and my clients are not expected to pay for anything they are not satisfied with.

One thing I am extremely passionate about: progress. You need a video editor because you're looking to move something forward, and I love it. Get me inspired on a new creative project and watch me get hooked, forgetting that I'm working, until all hours of the night.

What creative video projects are you doing? Do you have an athletic YouTube channel you want to make? Do you want to create make-up tutorial videos? Do you have a creative vision for a video which advertises your product? A light saber video you want rotoscoped? Any other types of creativity?? Let's chat, because I love that you are moving forwards and would be honored to add my creativity to your mix.

I have been doing videography and editing for 10+ years. I have a wide range of skills in working with Adobe Premiere, After Effects, and Photoshop. I have completed promo videos for Shasta County, local businesses and a few weddings (as well as a few awesome personal projects!).

Some bragging points...

+Years of experience
+Quick and efficient work flow
+I'm self employed (so I have plenty of time for fun video projects)
+Comprehensive knowledge of leading software
+Video Production and filming
+Editing
+I have completed a wide variety of video projects in the past (weddings, promos, stop motion animation projects... even a light saber fight short film [see my portfolio, you won't be disappointed!])
+I pride myself on excellent team communication, a must have for any any project.


Videography and Editing is one of my passions, as well as carrying out professional business transactions. I'm looking forwards to meeting with you and potentially working together!

My current typing speed is 125 WPM. From an early age, I've been able to develop a superior sense of literacy thanks to guidance that was initially relayed to me by my quite brilliant parents.

One of my most crucial educational experiences surprisingly involved my adolescence. Through sheer luck, I ended up winning a strict registration raffle process, leading me to attend Illinois' top magnet school: Lincoln Magnet Middle School. The administration and staff of Lincoln Magnet did an exemplary job at building a solid foundation for success, teaching hard skills that would later convert over to many of today's top industries. In addition, relevant applications and networks of today were heavily integrated into our learning, even while still in their infancy (Google Drive/Docs/Sheets, Modern Keynote, Intranet Functions, etc.)

With this baseline, I was able to manifest an unrivaled ability to not only understand English within the North American context but also accumulate vast knowledge pertaining to the nuances of North American sub-cultures. Much of my time in high school was spent developing these hard skills solo. Graduating a year early gave me an extra window of opportunity as well. My localizing and proofreading skills are second to none, with my vetting and drafting process GUARANTEEING consistent, professional work from my end.

I have extensive recording, mixing, and mastering experience, and have worked with multiple artists across multiple genres. The work we have produced has been nominated several times for the New Mexico Music Awards, as well as gained the attention of established record labels.

As a producer and instrumentalist, I’ve been producing “unofficially” for too long to remember an exact date, but have been doing so “officially” and professionally since 2015. My musical journey began at the age of four with formal classical piano training, and continued over the following 12 years, with the addition of guitar and percussion along the way. Experience during that time in the musical world included numerous competitions in performance and theory at the local, as well as national levels, and then took on the form of professional performance as a rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist from the early 1990’s until 2010. As a producer and composer, I have been nominated for, and the recipient of, several awards in arrangement production.

Sure. The video has to look good.

software engineer,Nichalus K.,https://www.freelancer.com/u/Aphemra,Aspiring game developer and recent CS graduate.,"I am an aspiring game developer who recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in game programming and simulation with a core concentration in programming in the Unity game engine with C# as the primary language.

I graduated from Pennsylvania College of Technology which boasts hands on experiential learning which allowed me to spend a majority of my time there working within the Unity engine instead of learning theory. This has given me a great amount of experience within the software stack when compared to equivalent graduates of the same topic.

I also have experience in graphic design and have a general knowledge of many facets of game development and can therefore speak on a basic level with most genres of career in relation to game development.

Outside of Unity, I have a reasonable expectation of myself that I could learn and onboard to any software/tech stack given enough time for the respective stack. This also means I can move into software and tool development as well, if required.

I have entered and achieved first-place in multiple poetry recitation competitions across the United States using my own work in English, Arabic, Spanish and French.


Over the last 20 years, I have worked in the private and public sectors, as well as for NGOs. I have experience directly working with Cultural Heritage Preservation. I have an interest in astronomy.

In addition to translation, I have a passion for education and educational technology that has led to work in instructional design, serious gaming, Augmented Reality, and Virtual Reality.

My name is Kayode, and as the title suggests, I specialize in resumes, cover letters, and LinkedIn profiles. As a recent college graduate from Georgetown University, I've seen first-hand how tough it is to land even an interview at most companies, let alone get an offer (my friends and I made a 'wall of rejections' in freshman year of college, and I'm proud to say I was the biggest contributor)

However, through years of trial-and-error, as well as editing student resumes at the Georgetown University Professional Writing Center, I've developed a specialized approach to getting your resume past those pesky application screeners.

In just two short 1-on-1 sessions, I'll arm you with the skills necessary to land you interviews at your companies of interest and a refreshed resume, cover letter, or LinkedIn profile (or all 3).

This process has helped my clients land competitive interviews and job offers in their fields of choice, from Civil Engineering to Sales. Feel free to browse through my profile to look at my prior work.

Still not convinced? Here are some of my stats/accomplishments

• 3 years of experience at the Georgetown University Professional Writing Center, helping over 300 undergraduate to Ph.D. students become more effective writers
• Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics from the Georgetown University McDonough School of Business (Ranked 5th in the US by Poets and Quants)

If you're someone who just wants to get a project done and start getting value from a quality automation solution, I can build it for you. Talking with you and discovering your pain points, then translating your needs into an automation solution is where I shine. If I can't come up with a valuable solution for your challenges, I'll be honest and tell you that I'm not the one you should be working with. I'm not interested in half-assing work for my clients. You'll get a well thought out and well tested solution with regular opportunities to provide feedback as we go through the process. And my job doesn't stop upon delivery of the project. I'll be available to support it going forward to make sure that you're successful. I'm of the attitude that I can only be as successful as my clients are.

I've also been doing Java development since 1999 and have a soft spot for that tech stack as well, but it works better for larger projects on more of an enterprise scale. If you're representing a larger organization looking for that type of solution, let's talk and see what we can come up with.

I have never found lack of familiarity to be an impediment in my work - whatever I need to learn, whatever research I need to do, and whatever level of abstraction I need to work at, I will. I am able to call upon all resources available to me, no matter how obscure, to find whatever information I am lacking and as much information as possible.

I have a set of deeply-held beliefs about best practices and the self-discipline to apply them consistently.

WHAT SETS ME APART FROM THE REST?

Please find me on LinkedIn here: [login to view URL]
Please have a look at my video intro: [login to view URL]

- My focus is your goals...not the technology. Everything that I do maps to helping you achieve your objectives. Always.

- Expertise. I have built a 25-year track record working directly with clients and coworkers delivering deep expertise combined with broad, industry knowledge. Today's leading web applications -- such as Facebook or Amazon -- are not built from one technology but, rather, from the convergence of many.

- Trust. For most of my career, I have worked directly with customers and clients as a trusted advisor in small and large organizations alike. If I can deliver it to you, I'll say so. If I can't, I'll say that too. If I think that an alternative will best suit your end goal, I'll suggest it to you.

WHAT IS IT THAT I DO?

The common theme of the focus of my career has been helping my clients and customers delivering software with the highest quality, meeting ever-increasing demands of complexity, spanning applications across multiple clouds and best-of-breed services to deliver premier consumer and enterprise application experiences, doing all of this securely, and doing all of this efficiently in order to get my clients to market as as quickly as possible.

HOW DO I ACCOMPLISH THIS?

Whether it’s designing a mobile app or developing a website, my focus is distilling ideas into usable experiences that delight people. I work competently in design and development, so I can take your project from concept to launch with a process that fits your timeline and budget. 

Designer by day.
I’m well versed in all aspects of design—I can take your project from ideation to deliverables and everything in between. My design process is unique for every project because every project is unique, but it always starts with understanding my client's goals. From there, I’m a proponent of less is more. With this mantra, I’ll layout a plan for designing the best possible product within your budget and by your deadline. 

Developer also by day. And sometimes by night.
When developing a website that I (or someone else) has designed, my mantra of “less is more"" also applies. I’ve developed sites across a variety of platforms and technologies, and my experience gives me insight into what tools work for which projects. Meaning your project gets engineered with technologies that's conducive to your needs and expectations.

Hello from Georgia! In a nutshell, I am more experienced than most, so I have a lot of insight into what will work best for my clients, but value their collaboration/input. I want them to be successful and not showcase my skills in impractical ways. I am on top of current design trends and seek inspiration from valuable sources before starting projects. I also have great marketing ideas with out-of-the-box thinking! I've won 47+ international design contests (as of January 2022), and have been runner-up in many more. I was also selected for the 2019 Best of Alpharetta (Georgia) Awards in the category of Graphic Designer.

My personality is fun loving and enthusiastic, but I'll let you know if your design ideas are going in the wrong direction, like back to the 90s. ;-) There is a science to graphic design, and it is NOT all a matter of opinion. Also important to know, is that I get on projects immediately and have quick turnaround. I am always on call and most always available except Saturdays. I encourage you to check out my portfolio, but most importantly, read my 5-STAR REVIEWS as your designs will be different. I look forward to working with you!

My name is Dave Singer, and I currently live in MI & can also work remote. I started my career with the company Liquid Web where I worked there for over a year and a half. In my job I've had to solve a wide range of issues from domain email connectivity troubleshooting to server wide service optimizations to spam & malicious software removal, making and restoring backups among many other server side tasks that needed to be done. After Liquid Web I moved on to InMotion Hosting with similar responsibilities. I continued my career there for an additional 4 years. I have since moved on to branch out on my own toward design & development. I took some time off during 2020 to regroup personally and looking to stretch my legs again.

More specifically my experience has been mostly with, but not limited to, Virtuozzo Redhat CentOS LAMP server environments using WHM/cPanel. I also have experience in Bash CLI scripting, WP CLI, BIND DNS, SFTP transfers, SSH, MTAs, MySQL configuration & optimization, CMS installation, troubleshooting, site restoration & migrations.

Beyond that I also found a desire to expand my knowledge of coding concepts beyond language punctuation. Where to set a variable or use an array or list as examples. Starting with Bash scripting for server functionality, CSS for design and dressing, then moving onto AutoHotkey to speed up tasks within Windows, and then began using Python for more detailed development. To me, the concept of a for loop is more valuable than if the line requires a semi-colon or spaces vs tabs. Tabs btw :)

If you are interested in utilizing my services or have any questions please feel free to contact me & let me know.

As a recent graduate of the University of Florida, my writing skills are sharp and have earned A's in my humanities classes. I am well-versed in technical documents such as lab reports and technical proposals, specifically in the land development field. However, there's nothing a few YouTube videos couldn't teach me. After all, that's what got me to graduate college.

On paper my skills are more technical, but I also have a knack for writing witty yet informative and educational content. This ultimately leads me here, as I aim to tap into the content creation market. My passions are fitness, geography, and, well, writing. Yes after writing a few personal pieces I realized this is where one of my passion lies. Therefore, if you're willing to take a chance on someone new to the game, I promise you I will not dissapoint. I am willing to go back and forth as much as desired to get you the content you need to help you stand out from your competitors. If you see me come across your dashboard, drop me a line at [login to view URL], I look forward to working with you.","Miami, United States","March 5, 2022",$20,0.0,0.0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

I've participated in almost every facet of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), providing me with a clear understanding of what it takes to deliver reliable, extensible and easy to maintain software and have demonstrated quantifiable improvements everywhere I have consulted.

software engineer,Scott C.,https://www.freelancer.com/u/ScottMCross,"Technical Writer, SQL Server DBA, Architect,Mentor","I have served in all aspects of software development. I started my career as a developer (C++), a database specialist, and network engineer. I have always believed that to be a successful software architect you had to master all facets of IT. 

I am an active Microsoft SQL Server DBA. Throughout my career I have served in the role as DBA as the typical software developer wants to live life in the “C” environment so SQL becomes an aggravation. Data is the key for all analytics and allows you to see into the future. This is critical to successful system design. I have always had a passion for data and decided to be a master of that environment.

I have served as a Director of IT, CIO, Director of Products, Security Officer, Software Developer Manager, and as a Senior Software Engineer. I owned an IT Consulting Company with 10+ employees. I have created HIPAA Security Plans (Audited), SDLCs (Audited), Business Continuity Plans (Audited), Operational SOPs (Audited), Software Documentation, and many Business Plans including Projections and Market Analysis. I have been very successful serving as a pre-sales architect in increasing sales.

I lost everything in the Pandemic and so I am offering my wisdom and services for very reasonable prices. I offer services in business writing, technical writing, SQL query writing, SQL admin services, business consulting, IT consulting, architecture consulting, mentoring, training, AGILE consulting, and other services that could make your company more successful. I code in C# .NET Winforms, but not an expert in Web development or Web Services.

I am a professional, client-facing developer with a consulting approach to service. I help translate business requirements into well designed and highly functional software.","Bangor, United States","February 27, 2019",$25,0.0,0.0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
