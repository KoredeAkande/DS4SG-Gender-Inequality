Worked in the accounting field, all the way from accounts payable to tax filings for most of my 20’s until I realized that it wasn’t for me and decided to emigrate to Germany to pursue a Phd in AI.

I feel like I bring a unique set of skills given my accounting background because I really get the practical side of things. I’m not afraid to just pull up an Excel spreadsheet and do some quick data analysis if that’s the best way to do it. I’m also not afraid to read the latest technical papers and apply it for a research project. Or anything in-between. I currently specialize in computer vision and neuromorphic computing. I take all of these things very seriously but my key focus is always on getting things done.

I am fluent in Python and Java. Worked on a number of machine learning projects including Misbehavior Detection in VANETs, Speaker Recognition, Spiking neural networks, StyleGAN and Variational Autoencoders. I also speak German and Chinese in addition to English. I’m an Excel wizard and I’m familiar with Quickbooks, Epicor, and Peoplesoft accounting systems.","Webster, United States","July 20, 2021",$35,2.7,4.9,2,0,100,87,87,N/A

Problem Solver. I like things tidy and neat, not only in my house but in bookkeeping as well. If there’s an issue to be resolved, I will seek a solution and put processes in place to ensure the issue doesn’t recur.

Communication. I like to obtain full detail of the task at hand and in turn, provide the solutions I’ve implemented in a clear and concise manner.

Learn. I love learning new things, whether it’s new Accounting software or other interests. I’ve successfully taken a number of online QuickBooks courses recently, and am eager to put my newly trained skill to use. Other things I’ve learned as a passionate hobby of mine - photography, from features on the lens and camera to proper lighting and focusing on the subject to be photographed.

I am an Accountant with a strong background in Accounts Payable and General Ledger, who has taken a brief break from the corporate world to move back to Michigan and assist with my elderly mother. For the past few years, I worked a seasonal position nearby that was less demanding then positions I’ve held in the past.

I’ve held jobs in accounting and finance for the past 20 years, but I don’t necessarily like to refer to my self as just an accountant. Fortunately, my career has always led to additional responsibilities and opportunities that aren’t typically associated with the role of an accountant. I possess great leadership skills, and have been told I display an above average loyalty and interest in anything I do or am assigned. I am always determined to not only meet expectations, but to go above and beyond. I have an amazing work ethic and have always been determined to continuously learn, research, and understand as much as I possibly could about my position and my department, as well as other departments that we are dependent on for info/data and/or that depend on us. I like to make sure we’re being as efficient as possible. My hard work, skillset, and above average knowledge/interest in more than just the accounting department, I was often simultaneously assigned or awarded project opportunities and responsibilities that went above and beyond my initial job description. I was always involved in process improvements, the mergers/acquisition team, joint venture committees, new product development team, etc. These additional opportunities include: personnel management, project management, process owner, testing lead, product owner, budget manager/owner, Merger & Acquisition Lead/SME (subject matter expert), and Data Warehouse SME. I have experience working in public accounting (CPA firm), for nonprofit organizations (FTE as well as Pro), and for small businesses as well as corporations such as a fortune 100 company (11 years in corporate finance as manager). Main focus and projects include (but are not limited to): merger and acquisition teams, testing new systems, product development, project management, data migration and testing, new IT system research, adoption, testing, and migration, financial reporting, data mining, SQL database research and inquiry, Microsoft excel expert, payroll, accounts payable, accounts receivable, FP&A, team manager, managed team overseas in India, reported (and compared with explanations (actual, budgeted, and projected financial results, worked with IT team daily and wrote requirements for new interfaces, database needs, table names, etc., wrote metadata definitions, created requirements for standard (daily, monthly, annual) reports as well as for adhoc reports, worked on projects with outside companies we partnered with such as Weight Watchers, Fitbit, Vitality, LLC, worked with upper management to report new LOB results, held weekly and monthly financial results meetings, worked on pricing contracts and negotiations with hospitals, Oracle, Microsoft Office, QuickBooks, PLSQL, Paychex, experience.","Louisville, United States","December 30, 2021",$30,0.0,0.0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

I primarily focus on small business accounting, bookkeeping and tax reporting. Business branding, expansion, and franchising. I also help with permits, licensing and title changes among other things. 

While in my course of my career I found that I have a passion for Engineering, in particular the build of steel structures. Inspiring me to pursue an education and career in structural engineering while balancing running a small business that helps other small businesses grow and home family life. I began applying for entry level positions in major engineering corporations in the oil and gas, renewable energy, industrial and manufacturing industries. I have experience assisting managers and vice presidents alike in major companies like ABS and ABS Group, a leading shipbuilder, vessel inspections, and turbine builder. Hines, a major player in building skyscrapers, high rises, museums, and hospitals. Crown Castle, a telecommunications infrastructure company. All run multibillion-dollar projects from inception to completion. I've also been a key player in creating proposals and winning million-dollar project bids for TAPP INC, a manufacturing company of transmission and distribution poles.

Therefore, I am looking for more project management experience to go hand in hand with the new education I am currently seeking while maintaining my self employment contracting services.","Houston, United States","March 2, 2022",$28,0.0,0.0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
accountant,Adeola J.,https://www.freelancer.com/u/adeolaja,M&A Dealmaker/Elite Small Business Finance Coach,"I am founding director of an investment group with Denton's law firm (The largest size law firm in the world), the board of directors that I lead (My mentors) has completed cumulatively over $80 Billion in financial transaction in the healthcare, mergers & acquisitions, and finance industries, and has over 250 years of expertise. We feature several high profile individuals ranging from a New Jersey Public CFO of the Year award winner, a Director for the Walmart family's personal real estate portfolio, and a former Director of sales for the legendary Cardinal Health who increased the legendary Cardinal Health's Healthcare sales department from $17 Billion/yr in revenue to $22 Billion/yr in revenue to name a few.

I specialize in building elite teams, like my company's team, for Start-up business owners that have virtually no finance background. I also specialize in teaching individuals how to acquire businesses and real estate worth millions of dollars using zero dollars of their own money. I do this by informing prospective business owners the counter-intuitive steps they need to take ranging from how to build a world-class, nationally respected team, like I did. How to retain Big 4 accountants and Top 10 International Law firms with no money out of pocket, like I did. How to create a rolodex of dozens of large financial institutions that are eager to finance your dream company BEFORE you make any revenue or even have a single client, and how to pitch a deal to private investors without having to give away any (as opposed to giving away the lion’s share of equity) of their equity in the transaction. How to build a multi-million dollar pipeline of sellers who want to sell their business to and work for you. How to create a management team and task forces to operate their current business or newly acquired businesses or real estate - and how to create and enforce high performance accountability structures within your companies to maximize results and minimize the risks that will become prevalent during the looming economic crisis. How to acquire properties and businesses with de-risked, government assistance at all time low-interest rates. How to use credit to create financial freedom… and a few other capital markets, economics, mergers and acquisitions, credit, and business administration concepts that can empower an individual who has little financial expertise to be very successful in their first year of business during the pandemic, and to remain financially stable if markets crash as the economy naturally moves on to a recessionary economic cycle.

I would like to work on projects with Prospective business owners and Start-up business owners. Any individual that currently does not have a company or a well formulated idea up to an individual that has existing operations generating $3 - 5 million dollars a year. Owners that are interested in creating financial freedom, creating generational wealth or establishing high performance businesses.","Lumberton, United States","January 3, 2022",$300,0.0,0.0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Don’t let the IRS take advantage of your hard-earned money. Review your US tax returns with a tax professional.

Some people think that not opening a letter from the IRS somehow magically constitutes not receiving the letter. IRS letters don’t work like that. Once it is in your mailbox, it is being mailed by the IRS. 
What to do when you received a letter from the IRS? You have options: taking care of it on your own (if you are a tax lawyer, an enrolled agent, or a CPA). Another option is to contact an enrolled agent that may save you money on the services provided and take care of your IRS problems on the IRS level (just like a CPA or a tax lawyer represent you on the IRS level). Enrolled agents are licensed to represent taxpayers before the IRS. “Tax lawyer near me” google search will take you to agencies that employ a tax lawyer, a CPA, and an enrolled agent. Tax lawyers can also represent you in tax court. A CPA or an enrolled agent can’t represent you in tax court. Most tax problem cases get resolved on the IRS level and never reach the tax court anyway.","Heath, United States","October 27, 2017",$99,5.7,5.0,28,3,100,100,95,20

In virtually every office environment, you will come across projects that reoccur at regular intervals, some weekly, some daily, some small and some large but in most instances my services can reduce the time spent on these tasks, virtually eliminating error and therefore saving money.

When working within an IT infrastructure, I am well suited for assessing the needs of a given challenge and for communicating those needs to the appropriate departments. Similarly, I have substantial experience working with smaller firms remotely and am able to assess and quantify their needs quickly.

While at White &Case, LLP I was in charge of the worldwide firm’s massive WordBasic macro set (a macro language built into Word 95). Although my original responsibility was to manage the existing code and write new code when requested, I took it upon myself to write some extensive documentation for the Help Desk to assist them in tracking problems relating to the macros. I understand that much of that documentation continued to be referenced up to the point that the firm converted to Word 2000.

I very much enjoy a challenge and have no problem in heavily researching Help files, the MSDN website, newsgroups and picking the brains of my colleagues. As a matter of pride, I work hard to avoid re-inventing the wheel. In most cases, I consider it my responsibility to deliver solutions that balance time, cost and quality and effectively as possible. In many cases, finding an existing product that fits the requirements 90% may be the best thing I can do for my client.
