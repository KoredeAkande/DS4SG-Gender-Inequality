Gender Inequality in Online Job Markets
==============================

In this project we explore gender inequality in online job markets with regards to pay and job opportunities. [Freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com/) serves as our platform in focus, and to account for confounding variables (and make equivalent comparisons), a genetic matching approach is used to find close counterfactuals.


Project Process
------------

1. Extract data for various occupations from Freelancer.com
2. Clean and preprocess extracted data (e.g. first name extraction, NA removal, etc.)
3. Predict gender based on first names
4. TBC .......
